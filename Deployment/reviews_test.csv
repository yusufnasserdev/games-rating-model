Cool unique characters with unique skills so you have to build multiple teams and setups and use strategy to beat harder levels. To address the poor reviews. All of them seem to be complaining that you are not just given the best things in this game like some other Argps. This is true, it is a grinding strategy game which I like because I know what my goals are, even if it takes a while. I like feeling accomplished, but yes it is Grindy at some points. There is auto fight option but during the auto you can still choose skills to use in the moment without turning it off which is a great feature that makes it interactive. To address the gatcha system, it‚Äôs like most, where the strong units seem rare, because they are, but I and many other players have had runs of good luck as well. It can definitely be f2p it just takes a bit longer, but it‚Äôs still very doable, many people and in chat are f2p and casual. The chat is friendly and people will always give advice so ask what to save gems for and such.It‚Äôs a new game so stick with it and if you feel stuck just remember that with farming, even casually, you will get better, not to mention that I‚Äôm sure it has many changes coming in the future!! (If they listen to us *wink wink*)', 'I‚Äôve played many mobile games similar to this but HOL is by far the best in class. The detail in the graphics are amazing, the combat action is continuous and active with sparks flying everywhere. HOL actually took the time to put a really great story together so I highly recommend you read it as you go.It is level based so there is a grind but with features like ‚Äúauto‚Äù repeat it takes the sting out of the grind. The events are frequent and interesting with a lot of rewards coming to you. Unlike other games where it feels almost impossible to get that good 5* or equipment,  HOL offers many ways for you to achieve what you‚Äôre looking for, from an intense crafting menu to an unlimited market or just the random drops from the dungeons. The f2p‚Äôs won‚Äôt struggle as mush here.My favorite part is the stuff, lots of stuff! HOL is very generous with free stuff. Imagine getting a 5* just because they did an update! Everyday HOL is giving you something! But if all that free stuff isn‚Äôt enough for you HOL has packs you can buy and in comparison with similar games these packs are reasonably priced for what you get.The Devs do a good job with keeping the game interesting by adding new content, servants and items and respond well to player feedback. Overall this game offers a lot and is definitely worth the play.', 'I have been playing since launch and I can say I have always loved this game. From its dark fantasy setting, to the beautifully rendered 3D models this game is eye candy. I appreciate how the Devs are constantly looking out for the long term health of the game and I especially enjoy how they actually listen to the community and make changes accordingly. I will admit the overall storyline is the weakest aspect of this game. It has been redone several times and I‚Äôd love for them to clean it up and make something memorable out of it. The game can be a tad grindy but then again they need to give you something to do so you don‚Äôt just cap out and run out of things to do/build. And yes while there are in app purchases YOU ARE NOT required to buy anything, in fact the game devs are very very generous in giving you free 5 star summon stones, karats and tons of other goodies just for logging in and doing events. I hope this game lasts a while cuz I love it!', 'I‚Äôve enjoyed playing this game for the past 3 weeks but unfortunately that would be coming to an end, for the game is finite! Once done with the world map, the only choices I see available is pvp, the occasional boss raid, and dungeon. which is not enough to keep me attracted. PVP in heir of light has a extremely unbalanced matchmaking  system which the current event forces its players to play in order to complete the event. I feel the game and its events are starting to seem like a job instead of a game, on top of that it‚Äôs boring!  And the idea of becoming the best in the world in pvp IN heir of light is unappealing. WHAT IM trying to say is I wish they would add more to the game and a new story itself and stop adding pvp and making players play it thru its events especially if it‚Äôs unbalanced. The game is worth playing in my opinion even if it is for a few weeks! There is a pay to win aspect which offers good deals to first players but afterwards MOST deals become 99$! PUMP YOUR BRAKES IS A MOBILE GAME ü§≠ quit trying to drain the players of their money! I know you need to get paid too, but try lowing the prices! I‚Äôm sure players would be more inclined to buy if they could see more reasonable and affordable prices for your packages!', 'This is a splendid game! I love the fact you don‚Äôt need to spend money to be good, though it certainly helps. There are a few flaws though. Transcending is cool and all but for LD 5* it‚Äôs next to impossible to use them unless you keep playing the game for years or spend insane amounts of money to keep up to pace with your rgb 5*. I get they‚Äôre more rare but that also makes the whole transcending aspect feel impossible and making the game very difficult to break into for new players when all the senior players have lvl 70+ ld and 80s rgb. If the PvP wasn‚Äôt pairing me against these players 99% of the time, it might not be an issue. You have a great game and some awesome aspects pulled from similar games (think toa in sw). However collabs hurt new players like myself. I really regret not having this game when AA‚Äôs and Valks were around or even John Wick for that matter. If you had some way for us to be able to obtain them other than Tower Invasion I would be very grateful because Tower Invasion just isn‚Äôt practical. All in all I will recommend this game to friends but I see some pain points which may prevent this game from the longevity it deserves.', 'As far as my experience with the game goes, it hasn‚Äôt been very satisfying thus far, I can‚Äôt recommend the game to anyone because I know they‚Äôll just end up with a frustrating experience- biggest issue of which is the extremely repetitive, lackluster gameplay. The bulk of the gameplay is an extremely slow and tedious level-grind to upgrade your units while in-game difficulty peaks fast. Many of game‚Äôs in-game models (and even the orchestral soundtrack) was copied off the Dark Souls/Bloodborne games. The guild feature lacks purpose as well because there are no guild events and there‚Äôs not much to do aside from chat and train. As to the gacha aspect, I‚Äôm close to 400 epic summons on 2 devices and still haven‚Äôt obtained a single 5-Star base unit. Seems the devs deliberately made the 5-Star units almost impossible to get then offer starter packs and summoning bundles in the shop so that you just buy them up front. The entire experience of working hard just to end up with 3 and 4-Star base units while heavy P2W players get to show-off is a big turn-off for me.Rating: 3/5 Overall an unsatisfying experience, the game lacks direction and excitement compared to other mobile games.', 'I was excited for the release of this game. It has a different but still familiar feel to the gameplay. I got to test the pre-launch version of the game and was mildly impressed with the direction the game was going. The graphics are beautiful and the environment is astounding. The story is intriguing to say the least. If not for a few grammatical errors here and there it is one of the better mobile game stories available. A few quirks like the skill usage (there‚Äôs no reason 2 characters couldn‚Äôt use skills simultaneously) could be improved on. I get that the idea is to do a ‚Äòreal time‚Äô turn based combat, but the result feels clunky. Rune system could use a bit more explanation and detail. An incorporation of mobs and bosses and a mixture of both throughout would enhance the experience of each level. Overall this game has a lot of potential and I look forward to the blossoming experience.', 'Ive gamed avidly since i was old enough to hold a controller and played mobile games since their inception. This is as good as it gets, PERIOD. Instantly I was impressed at the beautiful details put into this game i cant say enough about them, just gorgeous. As i played i fell in love with the original characters and their powers. Simply top notch. The difference of play styles available is just grand! Yet the interface operates simple enough for first time players to figure it out with little to no difficulty. Every character has a interesting back story that correlates to their particular abilities be it strength or weakness and many have a interesting history with each other crossed paths before or affected another in some indirect manner. I could continue but why?! Just play it and enjoy the excitement of the Hinterlands for yourself already!', 'I play ever rpg/ mmorpg I can find and this one Use to be my favorite mobile rpg but now they have pretty much said they no longer want players that will not spend 100$s a month just to get shards...not hero‚Äôs but shards u get 1 for 100 battles if you lucky and you need 500 shards to get 1 good hero. Now what makes that worse is the new update that allows you to make your hero‚Äôs transcendence lvl 10 u now need 60 of the same character which will literally will take you years to get. This is awful and an insult to players and yes I know developers only care about money but word of mouth travels and this will spread this game has went from a great game to a pitiful excuse and nothing more than a cash grab...and you don‚Äôt even get your money‚Äôs worth 90$ spent on gems and you still won‚Äôt pull what you need....thx for the fun but I‚Äôm deleting this game y‚Äôall have killed everything I enjoyed about your game and if you would actually listen to players and put a moderator in chat you would see you are disappointing and losing a lot of players daily.', 'As the title states, this game has improved greatly since launch. Many quality of life changes such as fast CDs which speed up combat a great deal, auto repeats for dungeons(10 at a time, should be infinite, but it‚Äôs a start). The summon rates seem better, I‚Äôve got about 4 five star summons just casually logging in over the past couple of months. Paying no money since launch. Graphics are top notch for a mobile game, don‚Äôt let anyone suggest otherwise. Smooth FPS and I personally have never encountered any connection issues. The game does get difficult and the strategy is surprisingly deep in order to keep progressing. Anyways, it‚Äôs a unique game of its type in a lot of ways, and seems to be steadily improved...plus they give tons of free stuff, what‚Äôs not to like there. Give it a chance, it will grow on you.']"
