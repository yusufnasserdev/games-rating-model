If that\'s all you\'ve got, stick together and try to engage from a closer distance. \n\n- Smoke will obscure your position from the enemy- utilize Smoke to sneak into position. \n\n- Use Flashbangs to temporarily stun your enemies. Stack your squad up and flash bang your way into the bomb site. Be careful not to stun your own squad members! \n\n- In a long match, on some rounds you may want to save your money so you can purchase stronger weapons for the next round. \n\nGood luck, Commander!",orbosphere,12+,EN,1171739648,Games,"Games, Action, Strategy",2017-11-15,2019-01-22,4.5,"['game good though problem ai way hard okay add ai level would make game better play', 'game really cool addicting like csgo mobile rts couple things wrong though first crashes bit much usually halftime andor super laggy ads also thing name characters cool accessories stats due fact overpowering online players multiplayer mode stats make sure cant hurt characters contracts retirement things lose best characters oh one thing needs freeroam mode otherwise game amazing thanks reading', 'really cool love problems like dude spraying team inside space second killing also team cant seem handle defending site opposite team walks nades anything team hardly anything keep balancing updating far great work', 'ideas skins soldiers game modes like domination survival zombies difficulty levels ai maybe user map creation new weapons teams really hope game works well good luck guys', 'always start pistols shotguns machine guns worse player controlled units always looking wrong way cant hit anything cant find weapons menu store player even money get better anyways lose every battle tried times giving game garbage', 'please update game feel like would amazing game added multiplayer also play freinds', 'plz near future make name dudes', 'good game please make need wifi', 'great game really fun pls keep updating game', 'like game wants lose every single time worst game ive ever played life']"

You will quickly be hooked!\n\nFeatures of PlunderChess\xae App:\n1) Colored Vests overlaying 2D chess pieces to indicate plundered powers.\n2) Practice board to build strategies and enhance your tactics.\n3) Analysis board to test active game piece maneuvers.\n4) Supports both Live and Turn Based 2-player action.\n5) Rankings System in leaderboard.\n6) Audible and text chat with your opponent.\n\nOptions for 2-Player Play (AI coming):\n1) ""Turn Based""...This option is RECOMMENDED for MOST of your play.  After connecting with your opponent, it allows you to make your move, then close out of app only to return after being notified when it is your turn again.\n2) ""Real Time""...This option should be used when you and your opponent are ready to play through an entire game in one sitting.\n\nYouTube:\nCheck out our YouTube video clips\u2026. enter: plunderchess in the search field.\n\nRead what others are saying about the PlunderChess\xae board game:\n1)  Cathi, Editor for NY State Empire Chess Magazine\u2026Product Review\u2026\n\u201cThis is an amazing and exciting new game which takes off from the regular game of chess using a regular chess board.  We discovered it at the famous USATE Tournament, brought it home, and it has become a favorite game at home, and among chess fans at our local chess club\u2026.\u201d\n\n2)  Becca, 12 year old student writes\u2026\n\u201cMy family and i love plunderchess!! it is the best ever!! we\'re always playing it! I used 2 dread it when my family played chess bc 2 me it was boring. but PLUNDERchess, now thats another story. its easy to understand and FUN!\u201d\n\nHere are a few of the BASIC Rules of PlunderChess\xae Play:\n1) ""Plundering"" occurs when a chess piece captures an opposing piece and ""plunders"" or ""acquires"" additional moving capabilities directly from the piece it just captured, hence, strengthening the capturing piece!  This plundering is illustrated by the overlaying of a colored banner (called ""vests"") on the piece that made the capture.  Image illustrations provided.\n\n2) The added moving capability provided by a plundered vest may be used one time only on any future move.  (I.e., the plundered vest may be used on it\'s very next move or carried around on the board and used later in the game, but only once.)\n\n3) Plundering is optional and may be declined by the player making the capture.  YES, sometimes you do NOT want to plunder a vest from the spoils of the kill!!  The case for NOT plundering would be if you suspect your opponent will immediately capture you back (making a ""trade"") and acquire the vest you just plundered!  (See rule #9)\n\n4) When plundering is elected, a ""colored vest banner"" that corresponds to the moving capabilities being plundered, gets overlaid upon the chess piece that made the kill.  This vest banner signifies to both players that the piece wearing it now has extra moving capabilities for one future move.","White Horse Games, LLC",4+,EN,29162496,Games,"Games, Board, Entertainment, Strategy",2014-02-18,2016-03-04,4.5,"['ive waiting forever ever since heard ill tell everyone know however needs computer version needs quicker asking accept remove vest fun variation game chess play friend play computer varying degrees difficulty app also puzzle packs practice cool', 'good game played somebody elses device decided get well worth money', 'dont even like chess like variation game much fun', 'love variation game lovecant get enough', 'love variation chess', 'really like playing chess game takes chess new level ability move piece capture amazing twist', 'plunderchess lot fun adds whole new twist game like one main plunder really spice things board', 'great game easy catch completely new way look look chess awesome game easily best chess app market right']"

Natural 20 Lite is a dice rolling app which handles single and multiple dice rolls. Its comfortable to use, saves time, and its easier than carrying a box of dice to each game! \n\n***************** Feature Summary *****************\n\n- Handles single and multiple dice rolls.\n- Default dice are D2, D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20 and D100. \n- Teacher\u2019s die for random letters.\n- Stores a history of your rolls.\n- Custom probability distribution plots.\n- iPad, iPhone and Apple Watch support.\n- Voice Over support\n- Cheaper than buying lots of dice!\n\n\n*************** Descriptions of the Free Features ***************\n\nHere\'s a brief description of Natural 20 Lite\u2019s screens, which are available free! \n\n~ Quick Roll \nSimply pick your dice, and you have an instant result.

The dice stored in your history can be easily re-rolled and filtered. You can move the dice around the screen, and it will remember your order. \n\n~ Distribution \nDistribution allows you to create probability distribution plots for specified dice. These will show you the percentage chance of rolling a particular face value, and you can compare actual rolls against theoretical results. However, large numbers of dice can take a long time to calculate for theoretical plots.\n\n\n*************** Features unlocked with an in-App Purchase ***************\nFor $0.99 USD you can permanently unlock the following screens, with a single in-app purchase. \n\n~ Calculator\n Great for large numbers of dice, or combinations with a modifier.\n\n~ Custom Die \nCustom Die lets you choose the sides of the dice, by separating them with commas.

For example the colour\u2019s hex number, HSB and RGB values. \n\n~ Direction Die \nThis will point you in a totally random direction with each spin. Swipe the screen to spin it, however you can only influence which way it spins, not the outcome! \n\n~ Success Die \nRepeatedly rolls D6\u2019s, discarding when they fail to meet a certain value. The total successes are displayed. \n\n~ Word Die\nKeep collections of words, to randomise at a touch. Ideal for selecting locations and enemies randomly. You can even randomise your words as a whole list. \n\n~ My Dice \nMy Dice allows you to save your own collections of dice, along with a description and optional modifier. These can be easily searched through, and rolled from a single tap. \n\n~ Dice Builder\nChose how many sides your dice have, and their colours!\n\n\n*************** Random Number Generation ***************\n\nNatural 20 Lite uses your devices built in randomiser (arc4random_uniform) to generate values.

The American colonies are outraged over new taxes imposed upon them by Great Britain. They begin to stockpile arms and organize militia. On April 18th, militia members ambush a column of 700 British Redcoats ordered to seize stockpiled arms. 273 British soldiers are killed or wounded before they reach safety in Boston. \n\nThe American Revolution has begun! \n\nNow you and your friends command the armies of the British Redcoats, English Loyalists, German Hessians, American Regulars, Patriots, French Regulars and Native Americans to decide the fate of the Americas. Players from each faction cooperate to gain control of key towns and forts. Share the fun in this light and fast paced game vs the AI, hotseat or online!\n\nKey Features \n\n1775: Rebellion features simple and unique game mechanics and special attention to historical detail. Experience this critical time in American history, you will not be disappointed! \n\n- 3 Scenarios \u2013 1775, 1775 (Short) and Siege of Quebec. \n- Play solo vs. 3 AI difficulties \n- 54 Cards (Movement & Event) \n- Cross-platform online play or up to 4 player hotseat multiplayer. \n- Faithful conversion of the original board game.\n\nAbout the Game \n\n1775: Rebellion is based on the award winning board game developed by Academy Games. \n\nThe mapboard represents the original 13 Colonies plus Maine, Nova Scotia, and Quebec. Each Colony is further subdivided into areas over which factions will struggle for control. A faction holds control of a Colony when only units of its side are present in the areas of a Colony. Player controlled factions include the Continental Army, Patriot Militia, British Regulars and Loyalist Militia. In addition to this the Allied French and Allied Hessian factions, which are controlled by American and British forces respectively, can be brought into the game by event cards playable by each faction. \n\nEach game is played in a series of rounds. Victory conditions are checked for each side starting on round three and each game ends with victory points being tallied automatically on round eight if no one has won before then. Each round is subdivided into four turns, one for each side, which happen in order determined by a blind draw of the turn marker for each faction. It is entirely possible for a faction to go last in a previous round only to go first in the next. \n\nMovement & Events \n\nEvery Faction has a deck of cards consisting of Event cards, Movement cards, and one Truce card. Every turn, each faction will play a movement card to maneuver their troops and any number of event cards.

In response to the resource crisis, the two most powerful corporations, BIOSPHERE and APEX, set off to lead a space expedition. To their amazement they discovered extensive resources on a strange planet far off of even the largest star maps. It contained precious exotic minerals whose energy levels were off the chart. This was earths answer. BIOSPHERE immediately started mining in anticipation of the prosperity and promise that the minerals could have for Earth. However, APEX saw the minerals as a highly lucrative business opportunity and promptly declared ownership of the planet and its vast resources. They ruthlessly engaged BIOSPHERE\u2019s forces intent on wiping them out. Only one corporation will make it back to Earth alive. The answer is up to you!\n \n=== Description ===\nMechCom is a new fast-paced stable 3D action RTS that is optimized for mobile devices. It\u2019s heavily influenced by the popular open-source RTS, Warzone 2100 and Dune. It takes place in the year 2100 when two corporations (BIOSPHERE and APEX) go at it deploying powerful mechs and heavy hardware from the mothership in a classic RTS environment in the hunt for resources. It uses fluid touch controls that are aimed for simplicity and ease of use. Classic old-school resource collection mechanics are favored as well as simple clear graphics. There are a number of customized mechs you can build as well as various structures. There are also a handful of upgrades that you can utilize which can mean the difference between victory and defeat against a clever and challenging AI. Finally there are a large number of maps (zones) to choose from for Custom Games or you can go with a Ranked Game where the computer matches you to your skill level depending on your rank and how many promotion points you have earned to keep you challenged.\n\n=== How To Play ===\nGameplay primarily consists of building individual units and structures on build pads. You build a refinery to harvest minerals and convert them to money. You then use the money to build a broad assortment of unit components, upgrades and an assortment of structures such as an Armory to unlock multiple component upgrades (also costing money) and a turret for example.

The last bastion of hope for Earth, E-CON operates out of vast militarised caverns and tries it's utmost to find a way to wrestle control of Earth back from the Insectron invaders.\n\n** Aliens: Insectron **\nThe basis for all Insectron 'life' are two substances believed to be based on highly advanced nanomachines.  The first substance, labelled 'Xenoaqua', is a quicksilver like substance which hardens to create Insectron structures and armour.  It is highly adaptable and will self-repair by absorbing more liquid Xenoaqua.  The second substance is 'Xenophy', a purple liquid, said to have the consistency of thick syrup.  Xenophy is thought to be the 'brains' inside the Insectron machines and the most vulnerable to damage.  It is unknown if the Insectron think with a' hivemind' or if they feel individuality, but both there is evidence to support both claims.  The Insectrons follow a pack mentality to the point they seem to share their perceptions on the battlefield almost instantaneously, they also display fear and self-survival when in danger.\n\n** Martians: The Holy Gravidus Republic (HGR) **\nHumans first settled on Mars midway into the 22nd century. Isolated for hundreds of years, the Colony on Mars grew into a religious order. While Earth burned for decades, the Insectron horde sent a much smaller force to occupy Mars; and while the Martians and Insectrons clashed, the Martian people were left relatively unhindered in their progress. Waiting for the perfect moment, the HTR have unleashed the full potential of their technology, wiping aside the Insectron occupation force. They now have their eyes set upon Earth, to reap revenge.\n\nFind us on Facebook \u2013 facebook.com/HexWar\nFollow us on Twitter - @HexWarGames \nGame Forum - hexwar.com/forums \n\nThank you for supporting our games! \n\n\xa9 2016 HexWar Games Ltd.\nAll Rights Reserved.""",HexWar Games Ltd,12+,EN,519126016,Games,"Games, Simulation, Strategy",2016-01-07,2016-03-25,3.5,"['game looks feels like regular hex war games almost impossible win even playing standard game enemy seems never miss seem always sure one worth moneyill stick civil war games absolutely love civil war hex games especially strategy historic info fan scifi game unique welcome addition list great hex games cool characters settings great mood music really put futuristic scifi state mind buck rogers would love game', 'enjoyed variation away usual hexwar campaign settings like music wish could play enemy aliens time equality', 'nice game gave one star cause waiting year two new updated game', 'interestingly wrote review couple months ago never showed resubmitting iti love hex warall games top notch similar substituting robots tanks twist factory manufactures replacements need defend addition control pointsalso excruciatingly slow even fast forwardits bad great see part picture says hex thats nothing']"

In a high fantasy setting, the game will take players through an adventure where magic and sword collide and friendship and betrayal intertwine.\n\nPartia 3 : The Knight of Partia is the third installment of the Partia series that wraps up the 'Granian Trilogy'. However, the game is designed as a stand-alone set in hundreds of years after the events of Partia 2, hence no knowledge of the prior games is required.\n\nThe game includes 30 stages (including 5 hidden stages) that should provide solid 30 plus hours of game play if not 50 or 100.\n\nIt is not a graphically good looking game nor has the big sprite animated battles that Fire Emblem games have. UI can be a bit clunky and looks 'meh', in most places at best.\n\nBut if there's any labor of love, this must be it. Despite the financial failures of the first two Partia games, I kept on making this game, alone for five years, putting all my free times and vacations into, because frankly I was obsessed about finishing off this thing.\n\nBut I've had a lot of fun making it, and I still had more fun playing the game myself. I'm sure you will have some joy out of it, if you are a fan of Fire Emblem and Tear Ring Saga series.\n\nNow mobile game landscape has changed a lot since I started out this journey back in 2011. There are now a lot of quality games in the App store, including a Fire Emblem itself!\nI realized a few years ago I no longer served any good value to customers who were looking for a little SRPG experience on mobile. As I'm writing this, Partia 2 sold slightly more than 2K units in 5 years. So obviously this is not a money making venture, of which I hope my next idea is going to be, unlike this Partia thing.\n\nAnyways, the result is a paid game, with no ad, no IAP, and no catch anywhere. I'm not even tracking any data as, frankly I don't see a point in doing that. You see I am already resigned to the fate this little big indie game is for the lovers only.\n\nFor The Lovers Only.\n\nSo this may be the final time I write a game description on an App Store. Or maybe not.\n\nWhoever you are, I hope you enjoy.

After forty years of oppression, the people of Eastern Europe are daring to defy their Communist overlords at home and in the Soviet Union. And as President, you too face daring decisions: how far will you go to encourage democratic reform? How much will you risk a Soviet crackdown on these freedom-seeking peoples? Will your efforts help bring democracy to Eastern Europe, or will you provoke the Soviet Union to bring down its wrath, setting the cause of freedom back by decades? \n\nThis is a strategy game about presidential decision-making in the context of the Bush 41 presidency in those epochal years of 1989 and 1990. As Poland legalizes Solidarity, as the Berlin Wall falls, as people in every country take to the streets seeking greater freedom and human rights, the world is changing under your feet. As President, you must analyze changing situations, weigh risks, and make decisions, all while trying to keep your alliances healthy, your relationships with foreign leaders strong, and the drive towards freedom and democracy always moving forward.

When you become the head of the country all the responsibility for the land\'s prosperity rests on your royal shoulders. You will have to fight various enemies and monsters, explore new territories, manage economic and scientific developments and solve a heap of unusual and unexpected tasks. For example, what will you do when all the gold in the kingdom transforms into cookies? Or how will you bring back the trolls who robbed caravans and whose disappearance ruins the economy of the country? \n\nThe core feature of ""Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim"" is that you cannot control your citizens directly. There are a lot of heroes in your lands: valiant warriors and warlike barbarians, powerful wizards and grim necromancers, industrious dwarves and skilful elves plus many more. But all of them live their own lives and decide for themselves what to do at any moment. You are able to issue orders but heroes will follow your commands only for a sizeable reward. \n\n""Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim"" contains elements of role play: while fulfilling your orders, the heroes improve their skills and talents, as well as earn cash to be spent on new equipment, weapons, and magical elixirs. \n\n""Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim"" \u2013 the throne is waiting for its hero! \n\nGame Features: \n\n- Legendary indirect control strategy totally adapted for iOS. \n- 10 types of heroes with dozens of statistics, weapons and armour. \n- A dozen types of monsters. \n- Several dozen spells. \n- 30 upgradeable building types. \n- 15 scenario missions+ a bonus one. \n- 3 difficulty levels. \n- About 100 game achievements. \n______________________________________ \n\n***** ""...Richest real-time strategy game I\u2019ve yet played on a phone or tablet, and also one of the more interesting games of this sort I have played on any system recently."" \u2013 The New York Time \n\n***** ""It\u2019s a great strategy game.

You can trade with each other and claim the precious land with all its resources.\n\nChallenge other Catan fans online via cross-platform multiplayer to prove your strategy skills or play against the AI:\nVarious computer opponents, each with their own individual characteristics, will prove themselves worthy competitors: the pirate Jean, who knows no compromise, Vincent the merchant, who never allows himself to be cheated, Sean the knight, who takes what is rightfully his...\n\nThe popular Catan expansions ""Seafarers"", ""Cities and Knights"" and two new special scenarios are available as In-App purchases.\n\nThe complete Seafarers expansion includes more than 10 additional scenarios with an extensive campaign. Become Harbormaster, discover new islands and extra game elements like ships, gold fields, treasures and pirates. Ahoy!\n\nThe Cities and Knights expansion introduces various new gameplay mechanics that add even more variety to Catan. Invest new trade goods in city improvements to build one of the three metropolises of Catan \u2013 but beware of the barbarians attracted by Catan\u2019s new wealth! You\u2019ll need your best knights to fend them off! C&K contains a short campaign and 7 challenging maps.\n\nExciting adventures await you in the two new scenarios ""Enchanted Land"" and ""The Great Canal"".

You can restore your InApp purchases by selecting the restore-option in the Catan IAP menu. \n\nQuestion: I lost my campaign progress after reinstalling, updating or restoring my device. Is there any way to restore it? \nAnswer: When saved games can\u2019t be automatically restored, we\u2019ve integrated a cheat code: In the campaign mode go to select player and enter ""CatanWarp*"" (* = 1\u201315) as your player name and confirm. Exit the game via the home button and restart it. The campaign can now be continued from the specified level number (1\u201315). Levels up to the specified number will be unlocked in the custom game mode as well. \n\nQuestion: Are dice rolls really random? \nAnswer: Of course! All dice rolls are 100% random and not modified in any way. We\u2019re avid Catan players ourselves. We\u2019ve played the iOS version hundreds of times while developing the program. There have been times when we won and lost a few games in a row because of the dice - just like when playing the board game! \n\n\n*****\nQuestions or suggestions for improvements: \nMail to

Kakuro is one of the top logic puzzles worldwide, appearing in printed newspapers, magazines, books, and numerous software implementations for smartphones, tablets and computers.\xa0\n\nWhether you are new to Kakuro or an experienced player currently using another app, you owe it to yourself to download and try Art of Kakuro. The app was designed to make the experience of playing Kakuro on a mobile device more efficient and enjoyable than anything else available. For example, in other Kakuro apps, adding notes to indicate what digits are possible in a row or column is annoyingly tedious. Art of Kakuro makes this far faster and easier by allowing multiple selections, and by allowing dragging across the number input buttons to enter multiple consecutive digits. As a result, entering notes for a row of three spaces with a sum of 10 takes 2 tap-and-swipe gestures instead of 24 taps. Advantages like these will make other apps seem frustrating once you\'ve used Art of Kakuro!\n\nArt of Kakuro also offers unparalleled choice in gameplay and appearance. There are a number of input control schemes used in various Kakuro apps, but only Art of Kakuro gives YOU the choice, with 11 input control variations available. Options for color scheme, background image and font allow you to find a style that looks good to YOU - and to change it periodically to keep it fresh.

An IQ level indicates how one is positioned compared to the majority of individuals in a given age bracket.\n\nThe application ""IQ Test: Calculate your IQ"" includes:\n\n*A free test of 10 questions :\nThis 10-question IQ test is based exclusively on logic. It will allow you to evaluate your capacity for reasoning, determine the range of your overall intelligence, and give you a fast estimation of your IQ level.\n\n*Two 50-question IQ tests : (paid)\nThe tests we offer were carefully prepared to evaluate the intelligence level of individuals. Psychologists supervised them preparation.\nYou will be able to calculate your IQ, compare your performance to the rest of the population and receive a detailed analysis of your intelligence.\nThis report gives a detailed assessment of your strengths and weaknesses in the four identified dimensions (verbal, logical, mathematical and spatial intelligence).\n\n*A 50-question IQ test for children aged between 8 and 14 years old. : (paid)\nThe test we offer had been carefully prepared by a psychologist for children aged between 8 and 14 years old. \nIt will allow you to evaluate your intelligence level in four key areas, namely: logic, arithmetic, vocabulary and comprehension.\nThis test was developed especially for children between the ages of 8 and 14 under the supervision of an English-speaking child psychologist. \nIt includes questions that correspond precisely to each age group concerned (8-9 years-old, 10-11 years-old, 12-13 years-old and 14 years-old), and, therefore, in order to obtain an accurate evaluation, it is important to declare the child\'s actual age right at the start of the test. \n\n*The IQ Expert challenge : (paid)\nThis test is intended for high IQ individuals (above 110) \nThe ""expert"" version of the standard IQ test was developed to enable respondents whose IQs are above average (normative IQ score is approximately 104) to take this new and somewhat challenging assessment without answering the same questions usually encountered in IQ tests. \nThis IQ Expert test challenges respondents because it includes questions slightly more difficult than those found in the more traditional IQ tests. \n\nHow to take this test:\n1. You have exactly 35 minutes to answer the 50 questions that follow. A countdown will begin as soon as you start the test and begins again each time the contents of the succeeding page are fully displayed.\n2. You cannot use a calculator, but pen and paper are permitted.\n3. Answer all questions and, if you are not able to, guess the answer. Intuitive responses are taken into account in the general evaluation.\n4. If a question seems to suggest more than a single answer among the given choices, select the one that appears most obvious or more ""reasonable"" to you.\n5. If a youngster of less than 15 years of age wants to take part in an IQ test, we strongly suggest that he/she takes the test for children rather than the regular IQ test. \nIt has been carefully prepared by a psychologist for children aged between 8 and 14 years old.\n\nWhat our users say:\n\nHi, thanx. I really had no problem taking the test. I\'m very satisfied with the results. I\'m really happy that I came off so intelligently! \nI feel truly confident and I had fun with it besides. HELEN - San Diego\n\nThanks for getting back to me so quickly. This is a good site and I hope you\'ll have success with it in the future as well. It sure deserves it!

The choice is yours!\n\nThe ultimate goal of My Planet is to grow a happy and thriving population. Your population will continue to grow as long as you have a healthy level of Vegetation on your planet (represented by the green bar). The more vegetation you have, the faster your population will grow. Likewise, if your vegetation levels get too low, your people will starve to death and population will begin to decline. \n\nVegetation grows when it has the proper amount of sunlight and water. For optimal vegetation and thus population growth, you must try to keep your Sun and Water levels in the sweet spot, indicated by your Sun and Water meters being 50% full. If you have too much sunlight, vegetation will dry up and your people will die. If you have too little sunlight, vegetation cannot grow and your people will starve. Same concept with water.

I have played SHG games for years. Best one yet ... awesome job guys!! \n\n-Wicked Space Game If you like SyFy then you should enjoy this game.\n\n-Addictive and full of hidden depths This is a simple game. Or so it seems at first, the gameplay is remarkably easy to get your fingers around (playing on a phone, that\'s an important feature). But what becomes addictive is not the simple play, but the depth of story that has been crafted.\n\n-Fun Stuff!! What an adventurous involving time I had playing Zombie Moon. Love the sounds and customizing my marine to do in the zombies. \n\nReview from one of the Game Creators\nAs one of the game creators, and player too, I love Zombie Moon and glad others are as well!  It\'s the mobile evolution of the existing www.starpirates.net, www.spybattle.com & www.gatesofcamelot.com.  It\'s actually in the same universe at, roughly, the same time.  The gameplay is streamlined as the mobile experience (and screensize!) leads to a different style of play.  For me, it works. \n\nI love the storyline that comes out through the Missions feature.  There is a mystery involved, and that unrolls through the Missions.  \n\nThe game is free; you really don\'t have to pay to play, nor give Snakehead private info, to continue.\n\nI love being part of an awesome Snakehead Games community that loves our games.  \n \n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFor news and updates follow us on social media:\n\nZombie Moon Twitter  https://twitter.com/zombiemoongame\n\nZombie Moon Facebook https://www.facebook.com/ZombieMoonMobile\n\n\nMORE REVIEWS\n\n- FANTASTIC -- This is the very first game I have played on my phone. Now I understand what my kids are saying. Its a lot of fun.\n\n- DOWNLOAD THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!!!! Awesome game.\n\n- MAFIAWARS MOVE OVER  -- I used to play Mafia Wars when it first came out. You know when Facebook was a wee lad. Anyway, it went from fun to demanding I pester everyone I know on facebook to advance. Ugh. Zombiemoon seems to have figured out the right balance. It\u2019s like the son of Mafia Wars, in space, fighting zombies. Me like!\n\n- Great game full of intrigue and mystery.\n\n-Phenomenal Story and Graphics -- Out of all of the social media / Browser Games I\'ve played, this one has the best graphics and sound I have seen.

Who will get the most land? Who gets the most Victory Points? Who is the most strategic one? Is it you?\n\nGame Features:\n - One Player - Freeplay or Missions\n - Online Multiplayer\n - Awesome graphics - pixel art!\n - Smooth and intuitive gameplay\n - Competitive leaderboards\n\nYour farmers must battle the opponents for resources, while at the same time acquiring food to live!\n\nYou both start off with two farmers; the first thing you\u2019ll need to do is acquire food for your farmers - each farmer consumes one bit of food per round! If you run out of food, the farmers will start to eat grain - and if they can\u2019t eat grain they\u2019ll take a bite from your Victory Points - which you DO NOT WANT THEM TO EAT!\n\nBut, you can\u2019t go around collecting food all day, that gets you nowhere and certainly won't get you any Victory Points! So you have to go set about gathering the other resources too! Each farmer can perform one action on each round - get more farmers to make more moves! Get some stone, wood, wheat, food and lots of animals to gain the edge on your opponent!\n\nThen its time to build! Each game starts with random building cards to give you (or the opponent) the upper hand. Some buildings are purely for Victory Points, while others are more practical - giving you food or other resources.\n\nYou're not just playing for fun either, you can compete in missions to test your winning strategy.

Allied and Soviet Tank Aces advance on Berlin; German Aces advance on London and Moscow. At least that's what the orders from HQ say. But since you face overwhelming odds and are forced to scavenge supplies as you go, you might just find yourself retreating instead.\n\nThe goal of each round of play is to clear the enemy from a map sector and drive them off the far bank of a river so that your side can cross and advance. Skills you will need to accomplish this are a working trigger finger, the ability to navigate West or East (left and right on the overhead map), and driving ability sufficient to crash into other vehicles.\n\nA status panel shows the number of enemies left, rounds remaining, fuel, and armor strength. The last three can be replenished by ramming (not shooting) an enemy truck. If you run out of fuel or armor, or for some reason drive your tank into the water, in addition to an untimely death you will be forced to retreat one sector.

Multiplis,Multiplication made fun,icons/1778.png,31,3.99,,"""Winner of Editor's Choice Award - Children's Technology Review and Parent's Choice Award!  \n\nWhat are people saying? \n\u201cMt. Multiplis is not just focused on getting the answer, but also understanding the process of multiplication and the strategies that kids need to develop. I love how this app supports my students\u2019 thinking in a way no other app does.\u201d - Alana S., K-5 Special Education Teacher\n\n\u201cI really like how Mt. Multiplis combines the area model and the number line. It\u2019s helped my students demonstrate their understanding across representations.\u201d - Yvette B., 3rd grade teacher\n\nAbout the game:\nLinka gets caught in a terrible storm while flying home after a successful treasure hunt. She escapes but her plane isn\u2019t as lucky. Help Linka make her way through Mt. Multiplis by building bridges, unlocking treasure, and earning gems. Rebuild Linka\u2019s plane by collecting the pieces from the greedy Crags who live on the island.   \n\nDeveloped by teachers and experts in children\u2019s cognition and learning, Mt. Multiplis is an engaging game that teaches multiplication through the commutative and distributive properties. While most multiplication apps focus on drill with digital worksheets and flashcards, Mt. Multiplis scaffolds learning to promote conceptual understanding, efficiency with multiplication strategies, and fact fluency. \n\nThe Common Core State Standards expect third graders to use the distributive property when multiplying (CCSM.3.OA.B.5): \u201cKnowing that 8 \xd7 5 = 40 and 8 \xd7 2 = 16, one can find 8 \xd7 7 as 8 \xd7 (5 + 2) = (8 \xd7 5) + (8 \xd7 2) = 40 + 16 = 56.\u201d Mt. Multiplis is designed to make this complex content more approachable and fun for kids. Students can think strategically, seeing how 7 x 8 is the same as 5 groups of 8 plus 2 more groups of 8.\n\nSupports Response to Intervention programs:\nMt. Multiplis is a great tool for classroom teachers looking to differentiate instruction for students. The app is also great for parents who want to support their children\u2019s learning. \n \nRecommended Grades: 3rd-5th (6th-8th intervention)\n\nMeets Common Core Math Standards: \n-3.OA.A.1   -3.OA.A.3   -3.OA.A.7   -3.OA.B.5\n\nAbout Teachley: \nFounded by former teachers, Teachley uses cognitive science research to create apps that teach effective learning strategies and assess what kids know within engaging games.

It has just as much pick up and play appeal as lighter roguelike fare while offering a bit more to chew on.\u201c\u2028\u2028\nShaun Musgrave, toucharcade, 4,5/5 stars\n\n\u201eCrowntakers is a tough combination of turn based strategy and Roguelike. It's quite satisfying, though.\u201c \nJennifer Allen, 148Apps, 4/5 stars\n\n\u201eHow many acronyms can you cram into a single game? Crowntakers is a PDL TBS RPG (that is, a procedural death labyrinth role-playing game with turn-based strategy combat) (\u2026) and it\u2019s really good fun if you like games like Final Fantasy Tactics.\u201c\nMichelle Star, CNET\n\n\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\nUser Ratings\n\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\n\n5/5 - If you like turn based tactical medieval rpg's get this. Not as much story/length as final fantasy tactics, but frankly on iDevices I consider that a win. Bite sized battles, winnable in a day on easy, challenging on hard, good replay value. Only crashed once on 1st gen mini\n\n5/5 - This is worth your money. You get a polished game, tactical battles, and thoughtful choices in exploration. Also big points for splitting the game into two difficulties. One being sort of roguelike with permadeath and the other much more RPG without permadeath and with consistent leveling. If you're thinking about this one, you'll probably thoroughly enjoy it like I do!\n\n5/5 - This game should get much more hype. I've been playing it non-stop in my free time for over a week. Despite some bugs (which the dev's have been very quick to address), Each game feels quite different with the random locations within areas, random loot and different party builds. It's not easy at first, but learning different strategies as you go is enjoyable. Highly recommend this game!\n\n5/5 - Big fan of this game. The battles are very tactical and the map navigation is really streamlined and fun to explore. This is a good one for any rogue-like fans. It's not super punishing, but it does present a nice challenge on the normal mode (haven't beaten it yet, but I hope a hard mode unlocks after doing so).""",Kalypso Media Group GmbH,12+,"EN, FR, DE, IT, JA, KO, RU, ZH, ES, ZH",693882880,Games,"Games, Role Playing, Strategy",2015-03-31,2017-04-03,4.5,"['excited game especially high review scores comparisons great roguelikes like ftl dead cells overall think worth buying kinks need worked unfortunately game great mechanics combat mechanics often obfuscated simply unexplained enemy special attacks movement range abilities always hidden making battles much trialanderror memorization strategy planning likewise important facets game vaguely represented like daily callout enemies getting stronger getting stronger higher hp damage enemies per fight much stronger apparent bugs missing mercenaries upon reloading save entering combat using potion effect etc last least theres real penalty taking much time want think games time pressure smoke firei think could stellar game needs work', 'game much promise execution average bordering lazy bad ive developed games years industry shame really instant kill save yes allow experience stay characters good make next impossible make enough money buy food get hps back lame spend rest characters refreshed well simple things overlooked dying third time easy mode means game hard balanced properly give stars effort promise im done hopefully rest developer games like suggestions fix game make food drink available taverns limited allow full health restore rest stops id given star know patch btw might back', 'im looking things rpgs delivers real good theres challenge pure exponential numbers game need grind get numbers higherit roguelike battles maps randomly generated likely lose times figure win thats key part game however roguelike like nethack infinitely deep detailed good dont time insane learning curve right ui well designed quick enough hasnt updated doesnt fill screen still quite pretty prob might play occasionally months', 'reviews overwhelmingly positive bethe negative seems entirely lose hard game even professional toucharcade review claimed hard however basic familiarity resource management strategy game remarkably easyits terrible say game easy needs hard difficulty beat second play easy difficulty almost first play beat normal beat every time epically overpowered party set selfchallenges like meleers want hard one ranged character kill infinite enemies', 'would given stars couple crashes highly recommend gameit fun although keep dying start kept interesting u lock different archetypes character mercenaries pick road save fatheri wish got choose one character king really one son spoiler alert son evil twin king saved queen need get business make heirs kingdom crowntakers', 'ive played game least times hard level never got past step make whatever assumptions skill saltiness choose keep readingresources hard come get little gold purchase items items purchase youre faced steadily declining hit points party either dont enough food dont enough food purchase food sirens time walking around map looking towers search get penalized enemies getting strongeryou get mushrooms way finding whether helpful harmful unless google game makes go outside game vital informationmultiple times ive accidentally moved character thought setting direction would face didnt realize still action points whatever reasonmy character start menu level three idea got level sense progression spite defeatsoverall nothing compelling enough game make figure save king good game bit less complicated roguelike games like instead ftl lot funone downside bugs dlc still unlocking mercenaries quest open unlock mercenary game crash try enter necropolis end step crashes every time reinstalling game anything except cause lose mercenaries unlocked progress thus fari learned hard way', 'love game beat nine ten times doesnt get old clear dont play intense action games like simple thoughtful games require strategic thinking decision making battle system game perfect kind thing furthermore enemies game level spend time moving map rpgs pays explore everywhere game must carefully weigh costs meandering lest enemies surpass strength', 'call rogue simplified tactics game play presented chance unlock mercs three different versions get unlocked use high replay valueif want new feel tactics style system worth moneyit hard learn gets easy optimize playedit love mashup old nes tunes dlc fight theme keep songs unnamed', 'game play okay agree positive comments however unstable game load sometimes load times problems include appear glitches game progression loading fame would load wouldnt allow game play uninstall lose progress dont buy addon also loads halfthetime really isnt necessary advance would recommend game issues even though game play actually play bad']"

It will definitely test your reflexes and can be a bit nuts at times in terms of difficulty, yet it manages to keep you engaged in a way that encourages you to do better. I highly recommend it to those who enjoy time management and simulation games."" -Vincent Paone, dadsgamingaddiction.com\n\n""There\'s an odd appeal to this game."" -Ryan Davis, Giantbomb.com\n\n""This seems like a cool game... I just want a corndog..."" -Jeff Gerstmann, Giantbomb.com\n\n\n***\n\nCook, Serve, Delicious is a strategic restaurant sim, one of the few in its genre that gives the players total control over where they want to take their restaurant.\n\nThe game centers on an old, worn down restaurant in the SherriSoda Tower, which was once the heart of the building but closed down as business (and tenants) dropped to an all time low. But with the local economy rising back up and occupancy reaching its maximum, SherriSoda Tower has decided to bring back the old Cook, Serve, Delicious restaurant, and has given you complete control to bring it back to its old five star status of world class dining.\n\nTo do that, you\u2019ll start with a few thousand dollars and thirty foods to choose from to put on your menu, as well as a host of restaurant equipment and more. Nearly everything is unlocked from the start of the game for you to purchase; this is your restaurant, and you must figure out the best strategy to get that restaurant packed with satisfied customers. Can you prove your culinary skills?\n\nAnd if that weren\u2019t enough, you\u2019ll also have the opportunity to be cast in the Iron Cook television show, throw parties for offices in SherriSoda Tower, read virtual mail in your SherriSoda Tower Email account which ranges from game tips to crazy spam, from customers providing feedback to your restaurant to opportunities to being able to fund projects via ""ClicknStart"" and other big surprises!\n\nWith hours of content and tons of secrets and unlockables, Cook, Serve, Delicious will provide a big challenge for anyone who\u2019s ready to take their crumbling, rat infested eatery to a luxurious Platinum Star Restaurant.

Use the Undo button (top right of screen) to undo last move if you make a mistake.\n3. Turn screen sideways to make view wider when you have a lot of cards in your hand.\n\nBasic Rules:\n\nEach player is dealt 3 \'face down cards\'. You are not allowed to see or change these until the end of the game. Next, 3 \'face up cards\' are placed on top. Finally, each player is dealt 3 cards to form their hand.

Although its offensive power was extremely high, the defensive ability was poor. \n\nSince no one knew how to utilize this war potential at that time, there might be \nvarious possibilities in the short term.\n\nAs a commander of the air craft carrier task force, make strategic decisions and lead your task force to the victory.\n\nIn this game, you will play the following important roles in the every layer.\n\n 1) Commander of aircraft carrier task force  - Make a Decision\n 2) Captain of aircraft carrier  \u2013 Maneuver your aircraft carrier \n 3) Pilot of Search Plane \u2013 Search Enemy\u2019s aircraft task force\n 4) Leader of Torpedo Attack Group  - Attack enemy aircraft by torpedoes\n 5) Leader of Bomber Attack Group  - Attack enemy aircraft by dive bombs\n 6) Leader of Intercept Fighter Group \u2013 Intercept enemy attack group\n\n1. Features\n\n 1) Every event is realized in the Real-Time simulation.\n 2) Player plays important roles in every layer.\n 3) There are many functions for shorten game time. \n 4) Tutorial Battle is avairable.\n\n2. Major Events in Aircraft Carrier Battle\n\n 1) The day before the battle\n 2) Search Enemy Fleet\n 3) Launch Attack Group\n 4) Wait Event\n 5) Enemy Search Plane Finds Your Fleet\n 6) Attack the Enemy Fleet\n 7) Enemy Attack Group arrives at our fleet area\n 8) Enemy Attack Group attacks our fleet\n 9) End of 1st Attack\n 10) Decision to 2nd Attack\n 11) End of Battle\n\n3. Major changes\n\nFor making this game more interesting, following items are modified from the real feature.\n\n 1) New aircraft carrier can be revived easily.\n 2) Aircraft on aircraft carrier is always fully carried when the carrier joins the battle.\n 3) New technologies like Rader, VT-fuse, Break-Code, etc, are not introduced.\n 4) The difference of the ability such as carriers, aircrafts, etc is not considered.\n\n4. Conclusion\n\nWe believe that the real aircraft carrier battle is realized in this application.\nWe would appreciate it if you would enjoy this game.\n\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000Null City Realtime Simulations",Hitoshi Yasui,12+,EN,230328320,Games,"Games, Simulation, Strategy",2017-04-17,2018-04-15,3.5,"['probably one best realistic open naval battle apps available great graphics variety actions locating enemy shipping attacking shipping dive bomb torpedo recovering flight defending shippingetc easy stars one accommodation please make easier locate enemy battleexchange even happen first place', 'thanks feedback understand requests made searching enemy process much realistic important thrilling scene however number people play small im considering adding easy mode read dev devs sarcastically sorry inconvenience game great good graphics mobile real game play reminds mod way wait game would fun messing japan winning ideas bugs one thing auto abortion leaving game make battle save like magic rated xbox game know nothing thing would like lot mean lot tells enemy attack comes auto know also merger bug rare intersection mission squad stopped moving sound affects working engine running moving looked enemy squad moving ships also auto search happens tell zone field zone always happens field common times shows good game aa cannon another cannon fire aaa ai another aa ai increase kills thanks reading', 'utterly speechless app several years since could find free aircraft carrier simulation game although accurately simulate aircraft carriers one disappointed would however suggest action like shoot enemy attacking aircraft handle aaa gun would tremendous thank efforts ps correct spelling errors', 'complaints pretty much always japanese enemy begins attack runs automatically moved carrier interceptor squadron great game', 'good bet search pretty hard cant take targets pls make little bit easier search', 'cant player use bomber torpedo aircraft time like real life', 'finally giving game tutorial hard follow aborted missions could find targetsplus even though american pilot everyone line pilots chatter japanese suspect give clues look aircraft carriers dont understand language', 'thanks feedback pilots chatter language sound effect japanese language understand searching enemy fleet difficult people want play consider next update', 'game god awful god awful tutorials im seasoned gamer days im still tries figure something delete onto next sorry', 'unable play iphone ios soon game loads screen gets oversized im unable access controls screen say love game makers platforms battleship submarine etc one yet', 'tutorial awful selected united states navy carriers would automatically switched japanese carriers']"

Genisys is destroyed and Skynet is offline, but the future war is far from over. Engage in large-scale strategic warfare and rejoin the struggle between machine and man. Build your base, attack your enemies and pave the way to victory for your clan in tactical multiplayer.\n\nPlarium, developer of the hit titles Vikings: War of Clans and Throne: Kingdom at War, has created a deep strategy MMO in the Terminator universe. Set directly after the events of the film, Terminator Genisys: Future War offers players a chance to reset the future with addictive gameplay, constant action, and massive clan warfare.\n\nWith two different playable factions, you can choose to take the role of a Resistance Commander or the leader of Skynet\u2019s Core, and either save the last of humanity or crush it under your cybernetic heel.\n\nJohn Connor is MIA, and the Resistance is broken. As a human commander, it is up to you to rebuild humanity\u2019s most determined military force, find and recruit survivors to your cause, and stop the machines from reactivating Skynet. Or you can betray humanity and convert yourself to join the machine regiments.\n\nWould you rather play as an unstoppable killing machine? With Skynet\u2019s primary core offline, your secondary protocols are clear. Construct factories, find lost battle schematics and terminate the human threat once and for all. If you feel sympathetic to the human cause, you can decide to reprogram yourself and fight alongside the Resistance.\n\nBoth sides are fighting for their lives and defeat is not an option. Arm yourself with futuristic tanks, relentless infantry and devastating weapons - and win the future war once and for all!\n\nNOTE: Terminator Genisys: Future War is completely free to play, but some in-game items can be purchased for real money. You can switch off the in-game purchase option in device settings.

Unfortunately, this is rarely straightforward, as fires may be inconveniently placed, blocked by burning oil barrels, or defended by blockades of ice.\n\nYou can create and destroy ice, but only below your current position, so thinking ahead is mandatory. . . and there are many traps for the unwary!\n\n(Note that if you find early levels too easy (or you find a particular level too frustrating!), you can always skip to a different level and come back later.)\n\nThe number of moves taken for your best solution is saved for each level, so you can strive for maximum efficiency if you so desire.\n\nThe intro levels are (skippable) tutorial stages, so don't worry about learning the basics of the game.\n\nGood luck!\n\nSummary:\n- Completely free.

The full version of the game will unlock the rest of the worlds and allow you to email and share your programs and maps as well as open maps and programs that your friends and family send you so you can teach and learn from them as well!\n\nCato is a little boy who just like every little boy likes to go out and play. One fine day Cato was playing outside when a portal to another world opened up in front of him; a portal to another world! \n\nCato stepped through and discovered that this world unlike his own didn\'t follow the same rules. Every time he tried to take a step or an action he\'d find himself stuck in place. Stuck that is until he finally discovered the rules in this universe: by writing a program for himself he would be able to overcome all obstacles and learn something new along the way! \n\nFeatures: \n* Simple programming interface using beautiful cards with pictures \n* 59 levels and 10 tutorials (always working to add more!) \n* Powerful map editor so you can create your own maps and puzzles and share with friends \n* Preview your maps directly in the map editor to save time and test out your maps more quickly! \n* Saves program progress so you can pick up at any time and iteratively develop \n* Email your puzzle solutions to share your genius with others \n* Beautiful artwork and amusing sound effects and music \n* A manual to help guide parents and more interested users \n* Puzzles ranging from easy to hard to teach different programming concepts without trying to force them \n* Loops, branches and if/else, and simple memory using colored flags are the main tools used to introduce programming \n* Emailed maps include gorgeous screenshot of what you are sending so your friends know what to expect \n* Cato\'s Hike teaches children (ages 5+) the essentials of programming and how to think about solving complex problems \n* The challenges in there are solvable easily by children of all ages but more nuanced and complex solutions should challenge teenagers and parents alike! \n* Just a fun puzzle game :) \n\nUpcoming features: \n* MORE LEVELS! \n* Hints on harder levels \n* Possibly more tutorial levels if enough ask for it \n* Possible cloud-sync \n\nEssentially, \'Cato\u2019s Hike\' is a universal game for the iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch to teach kids and young children basic programming skills. The younger ones will obviously enjoy solving levels using simpler coding techniques but the hope is the older ones will pick up more advanced concepts like loops and branching as well as even more advanced concepts like a basic stack or memory! There is enough in here to keep everyone from children to parents engaged! More challenges are upcoming however so stay tuned! \n\nAs with all my projects I take this one very seriously and I hope you enjoy. I intend to continue improving Cato\'s Hike as much as possible and incorporate your feedback and suggestions as well as try to make it more intuitive and better able to convey the concepts it is setting out to teach.

Play against a friend on your local Wi-Fi network or a computer opponent: Probe, the Computer Stratego World Champion. You can start a new game in seconds and pause a game to complete at a later time.\nHeroic Battle is easy to learn. Each game is different. You and your opponent set up your flags, bombs and other pieces and then venture out to try to capture the other\u2019s flag. But the catch is, you only learn the identity of your opponent\u2019s pieces during attacks. Many of the pieces\u2014miners, scouts, the spy\u2014have special properties that you\u2019ll discover as you play.\nOne of the great features of Heroic Battle is that you can create and save your own setups. Each setup produces a different kind of game. Do you prefer fast, wide open play or a slower more conservative pace? Do you want to fortify your flag and defend it or just hide it somewhere and dare your opponent to find it? It\u2019s up to you.\nHeroic Battle is fun to play with a friend. All you need is a local Wi-Fi network, no Internet connection required. One of you taps to create a game and the other taps to join it.

Even the simplest inferencing can be difficult for some children. Children begin to make observations when they can see something happening. In contrast, inferences are what they figure out based on an experience or relating to an experience, which is more abstract. Helping students understand when information is implied, or not directly stated, will improve their skills in drawing conclusions, making inferences/predictions, reasoning, problem solving, logic, critical thinking, cognitive skills and even social skills. Special needs students can benefit greatly from gaining inferencing abilities in this motivating format which provides the building blocks for more difficult inferencing.\n\nThese skills will be needed for all types of school assignments, including reading, science, social studies and many other subjects, as well as life in general. Inferential thinking is a complex skill that will develop over time and with experience. Questions may ask why a person may have responded as he did or what the child thinks will happen next. Because young children are quite literal, this is often very difficult and they have to \u201cread between the lines.\u201d\n\nQuestions are presented in a game format, giving the student the opportunity to choose the best answer, that would make the most logical sense, given the details provided. It will help students read into important situations in their future, simply by developing and expanding these important skills. Teachers, parents and therapists can use these for critical thinking discussion questions, rational thought, and common sense predictions. Some topics touch on common social skill scenarios. \n \nFEATURES: \n---------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 Over 100+ questions in random order\n\u2022 Answers are not directly stated in the question, so the user must use critical thinking abilities \n\u2022 Motivationally animated voice feedback after responses for encouragement \n\u2022 Brainy Bonus after every 5 correct questions offer a chance to take the challenge and earn a higher score\n\u2022 Classrooms with multiple iPads can set up Brainy Skills timed contests, to encourage friendly competition while building these important skills\n\u2022 Adjustable timer: 15, 30, 45, & 60 second settings\n\u2022 Mixed skills levels\n\u2022 No in app purchases as well as no distracting advertising allowing complete concentration for the user\n---------------------------------------------------\n \nHelps players improve reading comprehension skills while building confidence to score high! \n \nTry Brainy Skills Inferencing Game","A Brainy Choice, Inc.",4+,EN,14464000,Education,"Education, Strategy, Games, Trivia",2013-12-27,2019-07-27,4.0,"['greati love', 'love app teach inferencing skills makes even better doubles great reading practice']"

Well combine black suit card values (Spade and Club) with red suit values (Heart and Diamond) to add up to Zilch!\n\nSo as an example, combine a black King (value of 13) with a red 8, 2, and a 3. \xa0Make sense? \xa0The app helps you by showing the current values of the cards you have selected, and even turns green when you can remove the cards! \xa0Trust me, this game will be tough to put down.\n\nHere's a few other tidbits of info. \xa0The game saves your high score to Game Center so you can compare against your friends, and the rest of the world. \xa0Have multiple devices? The game will pull down and sync your high score across all your devices, so you don't have to worry about it. \xa0Also, it supports the new split screen multitasking feature for iPads, so while you browse the internet, you can leisurely play Zilch too!\n\nThe game was thought up on a road trip. \xa0My wife helped narrow down the rules, such as how many piles, number of cards in each pile, what the jokers do, you know, the majority of the game's rules.  However the game was designed to be able to be played with an ordinary deck of cards on your own!""",Jeff Harden,4+,EN,65154048,Games,"Games, Card, Entertainment, Strategy",2015-09-20,2016-06-01,3.5,"['seems easy grasp rules challenging havent yet get frustrated leave awhile havent problems crashing like reviewers mentioned four stars id like see difficulty levels hey id like win times cant blame author putting ads order monetize app least add option pay app ads go away added ads recent update previously paid app game simple entertaining becomes boring fast', 'cool add ads previously paid app fact cannot ever update fun game restore device factory settings get new device without put ads game already better fairer way developer manage apparent need generate ad revenue new downloaders app without punishing already bought game example push separate free lite version ads leaving paid adfree version intact already paid', 'found thru appsgonefree say one best promoted prefer thinking puzzles dont rush timers fail arent zapping enemies fast recommend everyone looking something different game', 'game quickly roped however quickly getting annoyed fact every time complete game crashesi hopeful fixed soon', 'far one best solitaire type games app store keeps coming back playing gameplay graphics point simple style keeps easy anyone jump great job jeff harden', 'fairly entertaining game problem keeps closing run usable cards instead letting play fixed id play often game fantastic fresh take classic solitaire however whenever run moves game crashes bug near game breaking severely annoying please fix', 'every single time get cards left crashes way win interesting game otherwise play win practice math']"
