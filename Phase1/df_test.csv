Genisys is destroyed and Skynet is offline, but the future war is far from over. Engage in large-scale strategic warfare and rejoin the struggle between machine and man. Build your base, attack your enemies and pave the way to victory for your clan in tactical multiplayer.\n\nPlarium, developer of the hit titles Vikings: War of Clans and Throne: Kingdom at War, has created a deep strategy MMO in the Terminator universe. Set directly after the events of the film, Terminator Genisys: Future War offers players a chance to reset the future with addictive gameplay, constant action, and massive clan warfare.\n\nWith two different playable factions, you can choose to take the role of a Resistance Commander or the leader of Skynet\u2019s Core, and either save the last of humanity or crush it under your cybernetic heel.\n\nJohn Connor is MIA, and the Resistance is broken. As a human commander, it is up to you to rebuild humanity\u2019s most determined military force, find and recruit survivors to your cause, and stop the machines from reactivating Skynet. Or you can betray humanity and convert yourself to join the machine regiments.\n\nWould you rather play as an unstoppable killing machine? With Skynet\u2019s primary core offline, your secondary protocols are clear. Construct factories, find lost battle schematics and terminate the human threat once and for all. If you feel sympathetic to the human cause, you can decide to reprogram yourself and fight alongside the Resistance.\n\nBoth sides are fighting for their lives and defeat is not an option. Arm yourself with futuristic tanks, relentless infantry and devastating weapons - and win the future war once and for all!\n\nNOTE: Terminator Genisys: Future War is completely free to play, but some in-game items can be purchased for real money. You can switch off the in-game purchase option in device settings.

Use hex based tactical combat to dominate foes on the Russian front of the Second World War. Fight as the Germans or the Soviets in a series of ever more complex missions. The Eastern front of World War II saw some of the most ferocious fighting, as the Red Army and the Wehrmacht pitted ever more powerful tanks against each other. While the early years of the war saw the Soviets struggle to withstand the German Blitzkrieg, the later stages saw the Red Army counter-attack in great force. Missions vary from straightforward wipe out the enemy scenarios, to capturing key objectives, to protecting vital supply convoys and constructing bridges to assault the enemy. There are a whole range of objectives to reflect the tactical complexity of warfare on the Eastern Front, and conquer your enemy with over 110 historical units.

Score bonuses and multi-bonuses for completing horizontal, vertical or diagonal rows. Complete the board within 8 turns and score a completion bonus & carry your score & unused rolls over to a new board (if playing Continuous mode).\n\nThe objective of Dice Match Bingo is to complete rows of random dice by matching them with the dice rolled at the top of the screen. The ultimate aim is to match every die on the game screen and score a completion bonus. You have 8 turns per game to try and match as many dice as possible. Every die you match scores points at the face value of that die.\n\nRows can be completed vertically, horizontally and diagonally from corner to corner. Every time a row is completed you will score bonus points - 100 for a horizontal row, 150 for a vertical row and 200 for a diagonal row. When you complete more than 1 row simultaneously, you score a 200 point bonus for each row completed in that turn. If you complete the entire grid, you will score a 1000 point bonus plus an additional 1000 points for every roll remaining in the game.\n\nYou earn a Bonus Die for every 10 games you play. Bonus Dice can be used to complete a board when you have 1 unmatched die left after your last roll.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThe screen has 6 dice along the top and a grid of 36 dice that are randomly allocated values at the start of the game. Begin by tapping on the Start button to take your first roll of the dice along the top. If the 'Show Match Hints' option in Settings is turned on, any dice on the grid that match any number rolled at the top will be highlighted and can be selected. As you select matches in the grid, your selection and the corresponding rolled die will turn blue. A blue rolled die cannot be used again in the current turn - however you can make it available again by tapping on a selected (blue) match in the grid to deselect it. You can also move a selected match by tapping on any other matched die with the same value.

(Free unlimited time demo, with IAP to unlock full version. Note that only full version can save progress.)\n\nNEO Scavenger is a game where you must survive in the wasteland long enough to figure out who you are. Each turn, you must decide where to go, how to scavenge for supplies, and how to deal with anything and anyone you encounter. And with each passing minute, the pit in your stomach grows, your dehydration worsens, your muscles tire, and your body temperature drops in the cold autumn air. Choose your starting abilities carefully, because they and your wit are the only tools you have in the apocalypse!\n\nFEATURES:\n\nUnique Setting - Near-future, post-apocalyptic Michigan with local cryptids and folklore. And something else beneath the surface... \n\nTurn-Based Play - Take your time with each turn, and play at your own pace. Save and quit when you want, and resume later. \n\nNo Grinding - There are no XP in NEO Scavenger. No levelling-up. Instead, progress comes from learning how to play the game better, and using your strengths to your advantage.\n\nSemi-Random - Much of the map is randomized each game, including the location of ruins, creatures, weather, and certain quest branches. \n\nSandbox or Story - Search for clues to your identity, what happened, and who\'s hunting you. Or simply test your mettle against man and nature alike. Play how you want! \n\nAbilities and Flaws - Choose abilities and flaws each time you play. Different combos unlock different abilities and quest branches. \n\nCrafting - Extensive crafting system which allows for substitutions of similar items. Make a rifle scope from half a pair of binoculars, or a noise trap from a pill bottle and pebbles. \n\nDesperate Combat - Detailed combat with moves like ""Tackle,"" ""Lure,"" ""Kick While Down,"" ""Demand Surrender,"" and ""Threaten."" \n\nRealistic Wounds - Creatures have complex wound simulation, with multiple wound locations, infection, bleeding, and pain management. \n\nRealistic Metabolism - Hypothermia, fatigue, thirst, hunger, disease, intoxication, shelter...everything is tracked. \n\nRealistic Inventory - Complex inventory system with slots for holding, wearing, containers, and more. Fit items in grid spaces, and manage encumbrance. \n\nHex-Based World Map - Navigate ruins, hills, forests, and plains in a hex-based map. Line-of-sight, elevation, and daylight matters. \n\nTracking - Creatures leave their tracks and spoor on the map, which can be followed by others. Players can also hide their tracks. \n\nHiding - Players can use hiding to avoid being seen while traveling the map, as well as during story encounters. \n\nHunting - Trap small game for food and fur, or track and kill larger prey on the map for butchering. \n\nForaging - Search for edible plants and water, and use special skills to identify what\'s safe to eat. \n\nCreature AI - Wandering creatures go about their own business, hunting, scavenging, and hoarding. Morale affects their choices, and some will gang-up and cause trouble. \n\nDynamic Weather - Temperature, rainfall, and night/day are based on real-world data for autumn in the area. If you live long enough, you may see snow fall. \n\nFULL VERSION ADDS:\n\nSave System - Save progress between sessions. However, if you die, that\'s it. NEO Scavenger is balanced around a single difficulty level: permadeath. Save games will be deleted if you die. So choose every action carefully!\n\nHaunting Soundtrack - Music composed by Josh Culler, specifically for NEO Scavenger, plays periodically, lending an atmosphere of loneliness and desperation.\n\nHacking - Use hacking skills to unlock scavenged laptops, cellphones, smartphones, and tablets. Mine them for paydata, or snoop through personal files. \n\nDetroit - Take refuge from the wasteland in one of mankind\'s last bastions of safety. Buy supplies, get medical care, and seek clues in a cyberpunk-styled city.\n\nMore items, crafting, creatures, encounters, and a larger map.","Blue Bottle Games, LLC",17+,EN,117317632,Games,"Games, Entertainment, Role Playing, Strategy",2017-07-26,2017-11-28,4.0,0.42754

Switch to the Grill Station to drag patties onto the grill and flip burgers to cook them evenly.  Jump to the Build Station to carefully craft your sandwiches with toppings and sauces exactly how they ordered, and deliver the finished burger to earn points and tips!\n\nEach Station is a hands-on experience, where you\'ll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the burger-building process.  With full multi-touch support, the process is more fun than ever before!  Tap many burgers at once to flip them all on the grill, or keep one finger on the Build Station\'s bin slider for even better precision when building.\n\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up.

This is the most sophisticated political strategy game ever created.\n\nUnique user interface\n\nDespite being vastly detailed under-the-hood, Democracy 3 has a unique user interface that makes visualising the connections between laws, policies, voters and situations easy.

A 'focus group' feature lets you look at individual voters and see exactly how they came to a decision to vote for you (or not!).\n\nDetailed policy model\n\nEach policy (or law) in the game has a slider which allows you to fine tune it's intensity to get the balance just right. A series of equations within the game allows the same policy to have radically different effects on each voter group at different points in the slider, so some voters may be indifferent to a policy unless it reaches extreme levels, for example.

They did happen, and they happened often, but they never matched the scale of the Western Theatre.  Starting in China in the 1930's the Chinese engaged the Japanese using Russian T26's and German Panzer I's.  The Japanese fought the Russians in 1939 and 1945, the Soviets with the one of the world's greatest generals, Zhukov, in command!\n\nIn 1941 the French in Vietnam briefly fought the Japanese with World War One era tanks.  In Burma and India, British Commonwealth forces regularly engaged in battle using equipment that would have been considered obsolete on the West Front.   Finally the titanic struggle between the Japanese and United States of American resulted in dozens of tank engagements.\n\nEven the Island War battles saw some engagements with over 30 Japanese tanks in a single mass assault.  Tank Battle: Pacific attempts to create many of these battles with a mixture of historical battles and themed scenarios that capture the experience of being a tank commander in the Pacific Theatre in World War Two.\n\nFight battles between Japan, France, China, Russia, British Commonwealth and The United States of America.  The game has a wide range of features from the tank battles of Northern Manchuria to the battlefields of Burma and the landings on the Pacific Islands.

You have exactly 35 minutes to answer the 50 questions that follow. A countdown will begin as soon as you start the test and begins again each time the contents of the succeeding page are fully displayed.\n2. You cannot use a calculator, but pen and paper are permitted.\n3. Answer all questions and, if you are not able to, guess the answer. Intuitive responses are taken into account in the general evaluation.\n4. If a question seems to suggest more than a single answer among the given choices, select the one that appears most obvious or more ""reasonable"" to you.\n5.

In a high fantasy setting, the game will take players through an adventure where magic and sword collide and friendship and betrayal intertwine.\n\nPartia 3 : The Knight of Partia is the third installment of the Partia series that wraps up the 'Granian Trilogy'. However, the game is designed as a stand-alone set in hundreds of years after the events of Partia 2, hence no knowledge of the prior games is required.\n\nThe game includes 30 stages (including 5 hidden stages) that should provide solid 30 plus hours of game play if not 50 or 100.\n\nIt is not a graphically good looking game nor has the big sprite animated battles that Fire Emblem games have. UI can be a bit clunky and looks 'meh', in most places at best.\n\nBut if there's any labor of love, this must be it. Despite the financial failures of the first two Partia games, I kept on making this game, alone for five years, putting all my free times and vacations into, because frankly I was obsessed about finishing off this thing.\n\nBut I've had a lot of fun making it, and I still had more fun playing the game myself. I'm sure you will have some joy out of it, if you are a fan of Fire Emblem and Tear Ring Saga series.\n\nNow mobile game landscape has changed a lot since I started out this journey back in 2011. There are now a lot of quality games in the App store, including a Fire Emblem itself!\nI realized a few years ago I no longer served any good value to customers who were looking for a little SRPG experience on mobile. As I'm writing this, Partia 2 sold slightly more than 2K units in 5 years. So obviously this is not a money making venture, of which I hope my next idea is going to be, unlike this Partia thing.\n\nAnyways, the result is a paid game, with no ad, no IAP, and no catch anywhere. I'm not even tracking any data as, frankly I don't see a point in doing that. You see I am already resigned to the fate this little big indie game is for the lovers only.\n\nFor The Lovers Only.\n\nSo this may be the final time I write a game description on an App Store. Or maybe not.\n\nWhoever you are, I hope you enjoy.

The full version contains a mate puzzle generator, many more difficulty levels, puzzles, pieces and boards.\n\nA more human chess engine.\n\nPrimus is an entirely original, modern chess engine specifically designed for the intermediate player (up to 2000 Elo). It has been carefully tuned to play less like a machine and more like a human. At lower levels, it makes blunders of a straightforward kind that are easy to spot, but at higher levels more careful play is required to take advantage of more subtle tactical and even strategic errors. At its highest levels, Primus plays at around 2000 Elo, but even at the very highest levels, it still has occasional simulated lapses of concentration.\n\nThe engine was conceived out of frustration with the overwhelming tactical strength of modern chess engines. Most modern chess engines are so tactically strong that extremely careful defensive and anti-computer play is required to make any progress; in other words, it\'s nothing like playing a human. We wanted to create an engine that allows for a more human, strategic style of play where there\'s room to take advantage of the occasional blunder.\n\nWe\'ve included multiplayer modes that allow you to use your device as a virtual chessboard, or play via bluetooth or wireless with a local opponent.\n\nFeatures in this ""lite"" version include:\n\n- Two player mode over Bluetooth / Lan.\n- Tabletop mode so you can use your device as a virtual chessboard.\n- Five different skill levels from total novice to expert (21 in the full version)\n- Supports all orientations, so you can make full use of your iPad Smart Case or stand.\n- Supports multitasking, so you can follow along with videos/ebooks.\n- Focus mode, to hide the UI so you can focus on the board.\n- Five selected puzzles and practice levels (30 in the full version), so you can practice your endgames or play some interesting challenge levels.\n- Mini-tournament mode - a six-game mini tournament mode for the more serious player.\n- Elo rating estimation from your game results.",DBRG Ltd.,4+,EN,81605632,Games,"Games, Entertainment, Strategy, Board",2016-05-19,2017-11-21,4.0,0.1479666666666666

With Vigilante 3, that decision is left with you. Be part of the problem, or the solution.\n\nThere are hundreds of unique NPC stories to investigate, and our NPC Story Generator lets you create in-game scenarios based on your own experiences. Ever been bullied? Threatened by a bill collector? Harassed by a rookie cop? Virtual revenge is available!  By creating your own story arc, you not only get to decide who deserves your brand of justice, but also what form it comes in. Choose your punishments - From a simple threat, mark, or black eye to something more stringent like a stabbing, robbery, or killing. You can see your stories manifested in game where you'll get the chance to take control of the situation. Wanted to give that guy that cut you off a beating? Not only can you get that opportunity, but you can observe how other players react under the same circumstances.

Read on \u2026.\n\nFOR THE BRIDGE MASTER\n\nBecoming frustrated with partner, and their bidding, is a fundamental aspect of playing Bridge (some actually seem to enjoy this!)\n\nThis frustration is multiplied tenfold in computer Bridge, when \u2018partner\u2019 is an inanimate AI Robot, who will not take any notice of your frowns and shouts, and with whom you cannot discuss matters over a drink. WiZBridge+ eliminates all this frustration, by \u2026eliminating \u2018partner\u2019!\n\nLoosely based on the established teaching game Mini Bridge,(with many improvements and innovations) ALL BIDDING IS DEFUNCT! Each player (starting with dealer) announces their HCP count, and the player with the highest count, from the partnership with the highest total, becomes the declarer. At this point, his partner becomes \u2018dummy\u2019 and tables his hand for all to see. Declarer now decides on the Trump suit, and the number of tricks that he\u2019ll make. As this is a computer game, you\u2019ll be making the decision and playing the cards whenever your side becomes declarers.\n\nDoes that sound easy \u2026 It\u2019s not! Because while you\u2019re deciding on trumps, and playing the cards, Robot is doing exactly the same thing behind the scenes. The aim of the game is to beat Robot in a \u2018head-to-head\u2019 game of Duplicate. Robot is an internationally acclaimed AI, so you\u2019ve got to be on your toes to get one over on him. Try it \u2026 you\u2019ll be amazed how challenging and rewarding it is. Then there\u2019s also the added \u2018spice\u2019 of playing Duplicate against other users (read all about it below)\n\nFOR THE BEGINNER AND INTERMEDIATE PLAYER\n\nYou\u2019re learning this game, and it\u2019s soooooo frustrating, especially the bidding. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to ditch this frustration and concentrate on the fun part \u2013 the actual card play. With WiZBridge+, you can have hours of fun simply playing contracts, while at the same time learning from Robot the best line of  play, and indeed in deciding what the contract should be. An invaluable tool for anyone who\u2019s on the long and sometimes arduous road of improving, or merely starting to learn Bridge. \n\nFOR THE ABSOLUTE NOVICE\n\nUndoubtedly the most complex and daunting aspect of learning Bridge is the bidding. WiZBridge+ bypasses the bidding, and enables complete novices to practice, enjoy, and improve on their card play and hand analysis., within minutes of downloading the app.\n\nAnd to help you learn, The app is packed with documents, Help files and Info buttons to guide and teach you along the way. You\u2019ll soon be progressing through the 4 levels, each level introduces more Bridge related complexity and strategy.\n\nDUPLICATE\n\nWhile It\u2019s great beating a Robot, it\u2019s a different level of thrill entirely when you beat your peers. WiZBridge+ has 24/7 Duplicate competitions, where you\u2019ll be competing with other players who\u2019ve been given exactly the same hands, and who\u2019ll also be trying to beat Robot on their own devices. Duplicate is available at the top two levels of WiZBridge+. Although there are no prizes, the real and meaningful prize is to watch your Statistics and averages improve over time.\n\nSTATISTICS & RANKS\n\nWe Bridge players love our statistics, and in WiZBridge+ they\u2019re in abundance. There are statistics at every level, where you can monitor your progress. In Duplicate there is also a Ranking system, so you can see the relative \u2018quality\u2019 of opponents in your competition. \n\nTHE FREE APP, & THE BITS THAT COST\n\nWe do not want one penny, cent or kopek before you are fully satisfied that WiZBridge+ is the app for you. For this reason we give everyone hundreds of free hands to try out and evaluate the app (100 when you download, an additional 100 when you register, and 80 free hands at each level of Duplicate) Thereafter there are in-app purchases of hands, ranging from 75 hands for only US$0.99 to $49.99 for 10000 hands.",Breva Bridge Card Game Ltd,4+,EN,135400448,Games,"Games, Education, Card, Strategy",2018-10-26,2019-07-29,4.0,0.6806428571428571

The pieces and their moves will be familiar to anyone that has played standard chess, which makes this an ideal game for players of all skill levels. Certain spaces on the board allow pieces to make special moves, some of which are simply mind-blowing. Special visual effects and sounds enhance play. You can play locally with friends or challenge yourself against 3 levels of artificial intelligence. You can play alone or in teams of 2 vs. 2.\n \nIf you like chess or chess variants, you can hardly afford to miss out on Warlord Chess.\n \nBut I don\u2019t know 4 good chess players...\nDon\u2019t worry! Using the unique tabletop interface, you can select games with 2, 3, or 4 players in them. You can add computer/AI players as needed.\n \nMost importantly, because of the nature of the game, people of mixed skill levels can enjoy playing together. You don\u2019t need to be a chess star to have fun with Warlord Chess. In a 4-player free-for-all, the best player does not necessarily win!\n \nThat is a crazy looking board...\nThat\u2019s true! It needed to be to fit 4 full armies. Plus, it allowed us to add special spaces that make for some incredible moves.\n \nThe Chaos Symbol: the symbol in the center of the board gives a special move to Pawns, Kings, and Knights. If one of those pieces begins its move from one of the spaces touched by the symbol \u2013 then they can begin their move *from* any one of those spaces. This helps the Pawn and King a bit\u2026but it works wonders for the Knight. Don\u2019t believe us? Just look at the screenshots below!\n \nThe Castle: each player begins with their army surrounding their castle. A castle is made up of three spaces known as The Throne, the Great Hall, and the Courtyard. These spaces enhance the way the Bishop, Rook, and Queen move. Beware the Queen in the Courtyard!\n \nBut I\u2019m Just Learning/No Good at Chess/Easily Confused...\nThen we have the *perfect* chess game for you. The interface was designed for everyone. Just touch a piece to see all the moves it can possibly make. Then tap the space you want it to move to. If you don\u2019t like it you can Cancel that move and try another. When you are sure of your move, you can press a button to Confirm it.\n \nIf you need practice, play a local game against a single opponent and set the AI to Easy. Increase the difficulty and number of players as you get better. You can even play team games and learn from your partner. There are so many options!\n \nWhat Have You Got For Us Experienced Players?\nWe\u2019ve got a lot. If you are *very* familiar with chess, then Warlord Chess will provide you with a brand new challenge. It is nearly impossible to control a board this big, especially against 3 players who are out to get you. So good luck with that. You can set the AI to \u201cHard\u201d in order to play against opponents that can see multiple moves ahead.\n \nWe\u2019ve also provided you with tools for analyzing your Warlord Chess games. You can save and load up to five games. With our Rewind, Forward, Start, and End buttons you can move through those games step-by-step so you can figure out why you lost, brainstorm some killer new moves, or relive past glories.\n \nWhat Else Have You Got?\nWe\u2019ve got a board that hovers and rotates over a roaring field of flame.

It\u2019s hard to put it down.... The game is mesmerizing\u2026. I have come to the conclusion that the best games in the App Store are those that concentrate more on the gameplay and concept, and less on having the fanciest, largest game around. My favorite games are the simplest and most elegant \u2026 and DodgeDot\u2122 tops the list\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been playing DodgeDot\u2122 for over 3 years and still enjoy it as much as I did then. If people would only try it, they would be pleasantly surprised why it\u2019s such a great game that\u2019s hard to put down\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is truly one of the few games I absolutely cannot bring myself to delete, no matter how low I become on memory. This is a definite must buy!!!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is great for all ages (at age 63, I should know) and the video instructions are beautifully done. \u2026worth way more than you\u2019re payin\u2019. As a retired teacher, I view this as a fantastic opportunity to both develop... and retain thinking skills. These folks put a lot of thought into development and execution! Don\u2019t pass it up!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis game has all the makings of a timeless classic. I find myself always coming back to DodgeDot\u2122.\u201d\n\n""Soooooooo Addicting. Seems easy till it blows your mind and you throw your iPod/iPhone at the ground. Either way great game I simply can\'t stop playing.  ""\n\n""Excellent game.

Protector, and it is your mission to defend the galaxy against the corrupt forces of the Krygons invasion fleet. The entire galaxy is your battlefield; which is divided off into 64 numbered quadrants. There are 8 rows of 8 to help you distinguish which aliens are in which quadrants, and which ones you need to focus on. However you only need to concern yourself with those intruders that inhabit the quadrant that you are patrolling. \n\nTrek Quest HD features:\n* Accurate re-creation of the classic Super Star Trek computer game\n* Easy to use controls\n* Engaging game play\n* Three levels of play\n* Trainee mode for learning the basics\n\nUse the phaser and photon torpedo weapons in your arsenal to help you gain control over your diabolical enemy. Use your deflector shields to ward off attacks; and survey the battlefield with your long range and short range scanners. You can also use a galaxy map, or star chart, to get a feel for what lays ahead of you.\n\nTrek Quest HD includes a trainee section and 3 increasingly difficult levels of play. The difference between the levels is the number of enemy craft which increase with the rank you select. The starting energy level of your ship and the remaining playing time also decrease as you progress from one level to the next. The trainee helps you learn the navigation of your ship, and how to operate the weapon systems. In this mode you start out nice and easy, with only one enemy and one star base in each quadrant. After you complete each quadrant, that sector will turn blue so you will know which areas you\'ve already conquered.\n\nMove about under warp drive or impulse power but be aware that the enemy is lurking, waiting to attack you. When your ship gets hit, your equipment may sustain damage. If that happens, the damage reports screens show the estimated time needed to repair your craft. If your rig becomes disabled, you can take a break at a star base and rest while your repairs are being taken care of.\n\nInfinite space brings infinite possibilities for mass destruction, so it\'s important to travel carefully into the cosmos.
