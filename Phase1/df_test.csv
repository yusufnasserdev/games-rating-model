Finish with him quickly when he resurrects.\nZombies are faster and more resistant than soldiers, but they need physical contact to do damage, so do not let them approach your soldiers!\n\nYou can manage your units from above, as in traditional strategy games, or enter into the unit you want and manage it individually, changing mode at any time.\n\nGo to the zombie side! You can handle waves of zombies to destroy enemy lines.\nWhen you handle a zombie in first person, come close to the enemy soldier, then this one will be caught and quickly die bitten, and in a few seconds will become a new zombie that you can handle.\n\nIn some missions you will also have to handle jeep, tanks, airplanes, helicopters, antiaircraft, to destroy the waves of zombies or enemy vehicles that will attack at the same time.\nIf all your soldiers are devoured, you will have lost the mission, even if you have vehicles remaining.\n\nPlace your tanks in a way that protects your soldiers, or in an ambush to force the zombies to pass through a narrow space and be killed by your soldiers.\nYou can also use this tactic with the city buildings.\n\nIn other missions there are factories, distributed by the map, that you will have to conquer to avoid that they continue making enemy soldiers.\nBe careful because you can lose your factories even if they are far from the battle front, for example if their defending soldiers are bombed by an enemy helicopter, when they die, they become zombies, and could conquer that factory.\nSo it is good to have groups of soldiers or tanks nearby to regain it as soon as possible.\n\nGreat variety of missions: under the apocalyptic reddish sky, in the mist, in the first mists of the morning, in the countryside, in the mountains, in the city, with soldiers, with zombies, with tanks, with airplanes or helicopters, with factories, with few units, with hundreds of units ...\n\nAnd if it was not enough, there is a complete missions editor to design your own battles by selecting the number of units:\nYou can put up to 300 soldiers against 300 zombies, land and air units, creating battles that will take your breath away!\n\nEnjoy Zombie Battles!",Luis Evaristo Rodriguez Campos,17+,"CA, NL, EN, FR, DE, IT, PT, ES, SV",48089088,Games,"Games, Action, Strategy, Entertainment",2016-12-19,2018-12-17,4.5

Build a party of fighters, priests, mages and thieves to run deep into the dungeon.  Test your courage and skill against groups of orcs, trolls, vampires and dragons.\n\nEarning its reputation as the thinking man's dungeon game, Oubliette blends the thrill of mortal combat with the sublime challenges of strategy, planning and adaptation.  Rather than testing your reaction speed and nerves, like a first person shooter, Oubliette challenges the player to do careful strategic planning as well as make tactical decisions in the heat of battle.\n\nEach player (character) in the game is created from one of eight player races, which vary in attributes such as strength, intelligence, dexterity and durability.  Elves are highly intelligent and (potentially) immortal, Orcs are strong with short life spans, Dwarves are strong with high wisdom, Kobolds are quite weak in most areas but advance more quickly.\n\nDepending on these attributes, each player will be qualified to join a limited number of player classes (occupations).  More balanced players will have more choices, including Hirebrand (fighter), Mage, Priest and Thief.  Less commonly, players may be qualified for a highly selective class with special skills such as Ranger, Sage, Paladin, Samurai or Ninja.\n\nUnlike games which focus on a single player against multiple opponents, Oubliette allows a party of up to 10 players with complementary skills to face the various types of monsters found in the dungeon.  There are more than 160 different monsters, and to deal with them, more than 150 different pieces of equipment, which may be enchanted with special properties or skills.\n\nOubliette is challenging, but forgiving.  New players commonly have their parties wiped out by an unfamiliar group of monsters.  In fact, your party can meet up to 3 monster groups at the same time!  Use the Temporal Chamber to save a Temporal Portal before dangerous trips.  If things turn out badly, use the Temporal Chamber to turn back the clock and try again.  The trapeze is every bit as thrilling, but safer, with a net below.\n\nIf you are up to the challenge, Oubliette is free to download and play.  Explore the easier levels of the dungeon to build your party and expertise.  And then, when you are ready, feel the power of the game on the deeper levels.  Onward to Glory!""",GabySoft,9+,EN,61472768,Games,"Games, Role Playing, Entertainment, Strategy",2010-08-26,2015-05-27,3.0

Most players either lose interest because it is too easy or feel frustrated because it is too difficult to solve.  \n\nAre you looking for a puzzle game that anyone can play, but still offers plenty to master? Look no further than LONPOS, it is a fantastic award winning game that has received a huge amount of attention around the world.  LONPOS is the result of many years of research and development to create a fun, enjoyable and challenging brain exercise game for all ages.  \n\nBeware, LONPOS is a very addictive game, so it\u2019s the perfect game to return to again and again.  Play it against yourself or have great fun when two or more players compete with each other to see who can finish a game first.\n\n\nLONPOS is an innovative game that enhances hand-eye coordination, improves cognitive logic skills, and trains short-term memory.  Playing the LONPOS is like doing a Yoga exercise with your brain.  It tickles your brain with an easy level puzzle that you can solve in a minute.  But don\u2019t be fooled \u2013 it is just a warm up exercise to prepare you for more challenging puzzles ahead.  When you play the more challenging level puzzles, it will give your brain a good stretch for hours, even days.  But when you complete the puzzle, you will feel like a genius with a fantastic sense of achievement and you're ready to move onto the next puzzle.\n\n\nLONPOS consists of 12 building blocks (known as Pentominoes), each unique in shape and color.  Each Pentomino can be rotated in 90\xb0 intervals or can be flipped in 180\xb0 to create a mirror image. Each puzzle revolves around a rectangular game board of 55 spaces.

The points are accumulated in the form of hands. Hand is same as trick in Spades. After the cards are dealt, players make call (bid) in the range of 1-13 hands that they expect to capture based on their cards. Players with several high cards and high number of spades would make a higher call than a player with mostly low cards and less spades cards. The cards are ranked form highest to lowest in the usual way (Ace being the highest and 2 being the lowest). Spades, as said earlier is higher ranked suit. Players try to play trick on other players to make them loose their higher cards. After playing five rounds, a player is declared winner with the highest points.\nIn this version, you will play with three intelligent robot players devised to simulate real-time players.

Control mighty battle ship turrets and try to defeat the other captian. You have to sink the oponens battleship by bombing it with rockets and missiles. Both players play on the same device against each other. If there is just one player this player could play against a computer controlled enemy.\n\nGameplay and controls:\nOn a playround two oponens face each others battleships. Each battleship has four turrets. At the beginning these canons are normal canons, but can be specialized and upgraded during the game. The turrets swing on a 90 degrees angle by themselves. The player can fire a canon by touching it. A fired canon needs to cool down for three seconds (greyed out). To hit the enemys battleship the player has to time the touching to lunch missiles to the right direction. Rockets can be catched and stopped by other rockets. If two rockets collide that player gets some gamecash the side the collision happened on. Players can buy turret upgrades from this gamecash every 60seconds (end of playround) on a special upgrade menu. If a player brings the lifebar of the enemy to zero the battleship explodes and the player wins.\n\nUpgrades:\nEach normal canon can be upgraded to one of four special turret systems. Once chosen these upgrades can't be removed or downgraded. Specialized canons can be upgraded two times to a higher level within their kind.\n\nHEAT: The heat canon is a pure defence weapon that can't damage the enemys battleship. Instead of rockets this turret sends out a special heat wave that can destroy multiple missiles.\n\nMINI: The mini-gun canon lunches normal rockets but has a lowered cool down time. This makes it possible to cause a real rainshower of bombs on the highest upgrade level.\n\nSTUN: The stun canon fires eletric bolts instead of missiles. These can't damage the enemys battleship but can disable enemy turrets for a while instead.\n\nCLUST: The cluster canon lunches special rockets that split up on their way to multiple normal missiles and causing therefor a lot of damage.\n\nTORPEDO: The torpedo canon fires torpedos that go under water. They can't be stopped or bounced. \n\nBOUNCE: The bounce canon fires a shockwave that bounces back all normal missiles.\n\n--\nMade in Berlin, Germany""",Marco Kehler,9+,EN,17678336,Games,"Games, Action, Strategy, Entertainment",2014-09-06,2015-04-09,4.5

Abalone has been one of the best games around for nearly 30 years, known for its hexagonal board and black and white marbles. The goal of this abstract board game is simple: push your opponent\u2019s marbles off the board! But beware, it\u2019s not easy to master, so keep your wits about you and rise to the challenge! \n\nHAVE A PLAN OF ATTACK... \n\nCreate a plan of attack to push your opponent\u2019s marbles off the board. On every turn, you can move one space in any direction with 1, 2, or 3 lined-up marbles. When you\u2019re in a Sumito position (that is, when your marbles both outnumber and are in contact with your opponent\u2019s) you can push their marbles out! For example, you need three black marbles to push one or two white marbles. There\u2019s no use in rushing; it\u2019s better to take your time and think of every possibility since one hasty move can put you in a bad position and let victory slip through your fingers. \n\n...AND HAVE A STRONG DEFENSE.\n\nIf you want to win, the key is not to attack, but rather to take specific positions with certain combinations of moves. Just like in chess and checkers, you can try to create traps by sacrificing marbles or strategic positions to block your opponent. The most dangerous contact points are at the edges of the board, where a bad move means losing a marble or the whole game! Sometimes, it\u2019s better to be patient if you want to win! \n\nDON\u2019T CONFUSE FORESIGHT AND HASTE \n\nThe keys to victory are looking ahead and analyzing your opponent\u2019s play. Although the game is easy to learn, it requires strategy and thought. To hone your strategic thinking, the game offers several modes that let you review your games play by play. For example, Challenge Mode helps you become a true Abalone master, one move at a time. The challenges get harder as you advance. For example, at first you must push out a single marble only to win a challenge, then two, and the master will get progressively tougher.\n \nPLAY ALONE OR WITH FRIENDS \n\nPlay alone against the computer with Challenge Mode and Free Play Mode, or play against your friends. With Pass & Play Mode, you can duel on the same device! Tired of playing your friends? Log in to your Asmodee.net account to face players from all around the world and make your way to the top through the new ranking!\n \nFeatures: \n\u2022 Solo:\n- 3 levels of difficulty against the AI (Easy, Medium, Hard)\n- A solo campaign with unique challenges\n- A game mode that lets you create your own game, your own rules, and place the first marbles \n\u2022 Multiplayer: \n- Pass & Play Mode\n- Online Mode \n\nTo find more information about Asmodee Digital, please go to http://www.asmodee-digital.com\n\nHaving an issue?

Can you achieve the ultimate goal of growing your planet to over 1,000,000 people?  Or will your planet burn under the sun while your people anguish?  The choice is yours!\n\nThe ultimate goal of My Planet is to grow a happy and thriving population. Your population will continue to grow as long as you have a healthy level of Vegetation on your planet (represented by the green bar). The more vegetation you have, the faster your population will grow. Likewise, if your vegetation levels get too low, your people will starve to death and population will begin to decline. \n\nVegetation grows when it has the proper amount of sunlight and water. For optimal vegetation and thus population growth, you must try to keep your Sun and Water levels in the sweet spot, indicated by your Sun and Water meters being 50% full. If you have too much sunlight, vegetation will dry up and your people will die. If you have too little sunlight, vegetation cannot grow and your people will starve. Same concept with water. If you have too much, vegetation will flood out and die. To little, and drought will set in. Check your planet every day to make sure you have the optimal amount of sun and water!\n\nI am always looking to improve my apps, so if you have any ideas on how to make My Planet better, please let me know.

New challenges added via the cloud and player rivalries will keep this game on the home screen of your iOS device. \n\nFrom Ed Anderson, the creator of ""ZDAY Survival Simulator"", ""Survivor Z"" is a text-based Role Playing Game set 311 days after the ZDAY apocalypse has wiped out 90% of the world\'s population.  Gameplay begins with an exciting strategy-based prologue, where the player has to make it home to the safety of their ZDAY bunker.  Then, fast forward almost a year, running low on food and water, our survivor is forced to emerge, only to find that the world has changed.  The population is decimated, and the dead roam the earth in incredible numbers.  Every decision a survivor makes can be the difference between life and death, and even the most seemingly trivial mistake can mean doom.\n\nExcellent Player resources and help from the developers can be found on player forums:  http://forums.mongadillo.com\n\nGameplay in Survivor Z expands on the concept of its predecessor, ""ZDAY Survival Simulator"".  While relying on the familiar text based model, Survivor Z introduces a vastly improved and incredibly robust game engine that gives the survivor complete control over their weapons, inventory, and armor.  In addition, players can use their items in context to complete challenges, as well as find an ally with non-player character survivors in the game.   \n\nSurvivor Z is the first game of its kind, combining the intellectual challenge of a text based RPG with the fast paced action of a board game.  But Survivor Z doesn\'t stop there, in addition to being a very entertaining adventure game, Survivor Z adds another dimension by utilizing cloud based game content that will continually provide survivors with new updates and challenges, and uses location based services to transform the landscape around the survivor into the post apocalyptic world of Survivor Z.\n\nSurvivors will find real world location challenges like the Newark Cinema in Delaware, Restaurants in Portland, Oregon, and even the Buddy Holly museum in Lubbock Texas to name just a few, as well as hundreds of other challenges that can be found in any town in the country.  Everyday coffee shops, fast food restaurants, hardware stores and malls are all transformed to become the backdrops for survivor strongholds, hidden troves of weapons and supplies, and dangerous traps set by rival survivors.  No matter where you go when you are playing Survivor Z, you are in the realm of the undead, and no place is safe.  \n\nOnce the player has fought through the fictional game content, the real work begins.  The player can search real world locations to find new challenges, unlock new stories, and try and build strongholds to protect against attacks from the undead and rival survivors.  Players fight to take and hold onto territory and resources as they struggle to survive.  The more your influence grows, the more powerful you will become.  Scavenge for supplies, craft fortifications and traps to protect your interests.

The remaining 20% are \nopen to the free competition of ships under other flags. These ships, called ""tramp"" ships, are usually prepared to transport all kinds of goods. This aspect of the shipping business is the focus of Ports of Call.\n\nThe Object of the Game\n\nEach player founds his own shipping \ncompany, with a starting capital of $4.6 million to buy ships. Freight and ports of call can be chosen continuously from offers on the market.\nThen the captain chooses an economic travelling speed and casts off to encounter many adventures on the high seas.\n\nAfter unloading his cargo, the captain \nis credited with the agreed payment.\nThen he may refuel, make necessary repairs, and so on. The next job is to find a new, lucrative cargo, buy further ships, and/or repay his mortgages; in other words, he must have a more productive company than his competitors.\n\nA player\'s chances of success improve \nthe more he knows about international \nshipping. All data for the game originated from actual developments in the maritime world: the fluctuation of freight rates, refueling costs, port charges, and ship operating costs.\n\nBut the game is not a pure economic game, \nalso a ship simulator is integrated, and\nthe captain can steer his ship manually,\neither if necessary, or to save money and\nget a good status.\n\nIn summary, Ports of Call has been developed with this motto in mind: \n""Software with Hard Facts.""\n\n\nlatest hints: start using preowned ships, and keep them in good condition to avoid disasters (like rats for example).\nTo avoid the burglar, visit your office in a regular interval.  \n\n\nhomepage: www.portsofcall.de\nsupport: www.rdkleinforum.de",Dipl.-Ing.

Rack the balls with a powerful break shot. Impress your friends your billiard playing skill! You don\u2019t have to buy an expensive pool table just to enjoy fun and addictive pool party with your friends. Just download our app and play for FREE! \n\nDo you love to play billiard? Have you ever dreamed of becoming a biliard or snooker master, playing bilyard on a pool live tour across the country? Maybe you even dream of participating in the World Pool Championship. To become a maestro, you must practice and play against tough opponents to sharpen your snooker skill. The problem is, like most people, you probably don\u2019t have access to a pool table 24/7.  However, you can still practice your skills by playing virtual 8ball pool on your iOS device. You can practice with your friends or random players who also enjoy playing snoker as much as you do. \n\nSome people like to play 9 ball pool and some people enjoy 8ball pool games. In Pool with Friends, the game you can play is the 8 ball pool version. The rule of the game is slightly different than the 9 ball version. For example, in the 8ball version, you may not put the opponent\u2019s balls into the pockets. By playing this game, you will be able to practice and learn about the rules of the game easily. \n\n=============================================================\nTOP FEATURES OF POOL WITH FRIENDS \u2013 EIGHT BALL POOL MULTIPLAYER: \n=============================================================\n\n#MULTIPLAYER BILLIARD GAME\n\nPlay with your friends offline or play with random players online.  You can also play against yourself to practice your shots.   \n\n#REALISTIC 3D SIMULATOR\n\nPool with Friends uses an advanced and realistic physic simulator. You will see how the balls move on the pool table when you hit the ball with different strength and direction. Enjoy playing as if you are pool billiards pro.   \n\n#BEAUTIFUL AND REALISTIC GRAPHIC\n\nWe handcrafted the game graphic to make it look realistic and sharp. The graphic will help you determine how to make the best and most accurate shot. \n\n#LEARN ABOUT THE RULES OF THE GAME WHILE PLAYING\n\nAfter your turn, we will check the table and inform you if you\u2019ve committed a foul. We will also inform you the name of the foul. For example Scratch is a foul when a player pockets the white ball. As the result, the opponent can choose where to place the white ball. This is a great way to memorize the rule of the 8 ball pool game. \n\n#SMOOTH GAMEPLAY AND GAME CONTROL\n\nTo play this game, first tap on the table to place the ball to rack. Then adjust the direction and the strength. Tap on the Hit button to hit the white ball. It\u2019s a very easy and straightforward gameplay, but it\u2019s not easy to master. You need to practice to understand the physic of the game and how the ball moves when you hit using certain level of strength to a certain direction.\n\nPlay pool (8 Ball) with your friends around the world.\nUsing turn based multiplayer, you can have multiple games going at the same time. Requires GameCenter and internet to play.\nFeaturing realistic physics, great graphics, standard rules, fun gameplay and highscores.\nWarning: Quitting the game after you hit the white ball and before your turn is over will result in a loss.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for?

Play the single player campaign or train against the AI.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nGalactic Conflict is a competitive SciFi RTS with a gameplay similar to Starcraft or Command & Conquer. You start out on your homeworld, build up your economy to gain valuable resources to research better technology and of course an impressive space fleet. Conquer new planets to expand your influence and increase your income and use your strategic thinking and perfect execution to ultimately defeat your opponents \u2013 either online or against the AI.\n\nGalactic Conflict was explicitly developed for tablets but brings real time strategy on a scale previously unseen on mobile devices. You can literally control hundreds of space ships at the same time. Ships come at all sizes: watch small fighters and corvettes dog-fighting for strikecraft supremacy, bombers swarming enemy ships, frigates hypering in to lay waste to an enemy planet or unleash the tremendous firepower of the huge capital ships.\n\nSINGLE PLAYER CAMPAIGN\n\nEnjoy the single player campaign where the Terran Confederation\u2019s home planet has been attacked by the mysterious Pyros race without prior notice. Only a small fleet of Terrans could survive the cowardly attack and they are now on the run. Join the terran space fleet in 12 immersive missions, help protect the only survivors of the human race and find the best strategies to repel the invaders.\n\nSKIRMISH AGAINST THE AI\n\nPlay against AI opponents in four different difficulty settings in numerous galaxies to shape up for multiplayer.

Can you gain #1 on the Game Center leaderboards?\n\nGAME BALANCE\n\nGalactic Conflict features two distinct races each having 13 different space ships. It is easy to control on a touch device even for newcomers to strategy games but still provides good strategic depth for real-time strategy fans. We all know that in strategy games, the meta-game shifts as new strategies are discovered by innovative players and this needs continuous small adjustments to the gameplay often referred to as \u201cbalancing the game\u201d.\nThe game was made by experienced, passionate real-time strategy players and as such, we are dedicated to keep the game balanced for the best multiplayer experience.\n\nFEEDBACK\n\nWe encourage you to leave feedback on the AppStore so other players know how awesome the game is.

The player chooses the location of the stand, the tools to buy, the employees to hire (you could need a cashier to quicken the queue or a juggler to entertain the clients), whether to spend money on promotion, the recipe of the ice cream (watery and cheap or rich and expensive?), how much stock, often perishable, to buy.\n\nThe player strives to control his or her heartbeat while looking at the people walking around his stand, buying or not buying his or her ice cream as a function of the strategic decisions taken before and may decide to modify them in real time changing the settings in the Marketing Mixer.\nAt the end of each working day, the game presents economic and financial reports showing the results of the day. The following day, the player can change his or her strategies according to the experience gained.\nThe players can compete with each other, sending their results to Facebook score, which compares them, allowing them to understand how good they are in selling ice cream.\n\nBocconi Ice Cream Empire: have fun discovering management.",Playerthree,4+,"CS, NL, EN, FR, DE, IT, JA, KO, PL, PT, RU, ZH, ES, SV, ZH, TR",46927872,Education,"Education, Games, Strategy",2013-06-21,2013-10-27,3.5

It is interesting mostly because it was coded entirely on an iPad in Lua using the Codea application from Two Lives Left.\n\nThe sprites in the game were drawn using Spritely, the sprite editor which comes with Codea.\n\nThe source code for this game and a description of how it was built is available for download at the Codea Tutorial site (http://codeatuts.blogspot.com.au/)\n\nOBJECTIVE:\n\nThe objective of the game is to clear the grid without tapping any of the mines. If you tap a mine the game is over.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\nFrom the menu you can select Easy, Medium or Hard games. The difference in difficulty is determined by the size of the game grid and the number of mines.\n\nEasy - grid dimensions 8x8 with 8 mines\nMedium - grid dimensions 15x15 with 30 mines\nHard - grid dimension 18x18 with 60 mines\n\nThe game screen shows the number of cells not cleared in the top left hand corner and game duration on the right. Tapping on the game grid will reveal either an empty square or a mine.\n\nThe first tap is a gamble. In this version of Minesweeper it is possible for your first tap to be on a mine. Mines are placed randomly in different positions each game. If there are no mines surrounding the cell you tap then all of these cells will also be revealed at the same time. If there is a number in a revealed cell this indicates the number of mines in the surrounding cells. You can use this information to deduce the location of the mines.\n\nMathematically it has been shown that the highest chance of clearing multiple cells is by tapping in a corner.\n\nThere are three buttons on the game screen:\n\nShow/Flag: Tapping the shovel or flag icon at the bottom of the screen will toggle between show and flag mode. In show mode, tapping a cell will reveal it. In flag mode, tapping a cell will place a flag on it, indicating there may be a mine underneath. You don't have to use flags but they make the game easier to solve.\n\nNew: Will reset the grid and start a new game.\n\nMenu: If tapped will take you back to the Menu screen.\n\nHIGHSCORE:\n\nThe high score for each of the three game difficulties is stored. You get a high score by solving the grid in the shortest recorded time.""",Reefwing Software,4+,EN,6858752,Games,"Games, Simulation, Strategy",2012-08-31,2016-01-14,4.5

Very few, unless you\u2019re talking about DodgeDot\u2122! What on earth can make a game so simple, yet so compelling and addictive? Why is the DodgeDot\u2122 player community so fanatic and dedicated?\n\nDodgeDot\u2122 is truly a game for everybody with players around the world from 2 years old to in their nineties. With over 22 miliion games played to date, it\u2019s incredibly simple to play. DodgeDot\u2122\u2019s basic rules can be described in less than a minute and many players learn the basics just by jumping in and quickly discovering them by trial and error. It\'s a game that can be played at a gentle and relaxing pace and yet also provides plenty of challenges for players that want to develop their dexterity, playing strategy, and overall game skills for competition. \nDodgeDot\u2122 is elegantly simple, yet produces infinitely rich gameplay:\n\n- Drag the moving colored dots to matching goals to score points\n- Clear all moving dots from field to advance to the next level\n- Avoid colliding with dots of different colors\n- Avoid contacting unmatched goals of different colors\n- Join dots of the same color to earn bonus points\n\nThe nature of the game\'s dynamics are infinitely variable, with its dots moving in different directions and speeds, and with time and every player interaction affecting the subsequent dot movement patterns and point values.\n\nDodgeDot\u2122 is also a visually pleasing game of colors.  Choose your favorite four-color schemes to play with, from a large selection of palettes.\n\n- New Game Rounds with fresh starting patterns for Levels automatically start every Monday!\n\n- Built in leaderboard network where you can have your own profile, see rank listings for players, friend other players,etc.\n\n- All registered Jampaq Network players have an opportunity to compete for fresh rankings every week!\n\n- Supports Apple\'s Game Center for high score leaderboard!\n \n- This is a universal application, so buy it for iPhone/iPod Touch and you can also install it on your iPad!\n\n*** WAS FEATURED ON Apple\'s ""WHAT\'S HOT"" LIST! ***\n\nDON\'T FORGET TO JOIN THE JAMPAQ NETWORK!\nREGISTRATION\'S FREE & SIMPLE IN-APP!\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \nWatch videos at: \nhttp://www.youtube.com/dodgedot \n\nHere\u2019s what DodgeDot\u2122 players have to say:\n\n\u201cTotal Addiction!!!!  It\u2019s hard to put it down.... The game is mesmerizing\u2026. I have come to the conclusion that the best games in the App Store are those that concentrate more on the gameplay and concept, and less on having the fanciest, largest game around. My favorite games are the simplest and most elegant \u2026 and DodgeDot\u2122 tops the list\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been playing DodgeDot\u2122 for over 3 years and still enjoy it as much as I did then. If people would only try it, they would be pleasantly surprised why it\u2019s such a great game that\u2019s hard to put down\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is truly one of the few games I absolutely cannot bring myself to delete, no matter how low I become on memory. This is a definite must buy!!!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is great for all ages (at age 63, I should know) and the video instructions are beautifully done. \u2026worth way more than you\u2019re payin\u2019. As a retired teacher, I view this as a fantastic opportunity to both develop... and retain thinking skills. These folks put a lot of thought into development and execution! Don\u2019t pass it up!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis game has all the makings of a timeless classic. I find myself always coming back to DodgeDot\u2122.\u201d\n\n""Soooooooo Addicting. Seems easy till it blows your mind and you throw your iPod/iPhone at the ground. Either way great game I simply can\'t stop playing.  ""\n\n""Excellent game. Entire family from 3 to 83 loves it""\n\n""This may be the winner on my list of \'Most addictive games for the iPad.\' My daughter is addicted, I\'m addicted and my mother is addicted!

The last three can be replenished by ramming (not shooting) an enemy truck. If you run out of fuel or armor, or for some reason drive your tank into the water, in addition to an untimely death you will be forced to retreat one sector. If you wipe out the enemies you will advance one sector, retaining any excess supplies you have scavenged. The game ends when you take the enemy capitol, or they overrun yours.

Prepare to say goodbye to pen and paper simplicity, and say hello to TAC!  The rules are familiar, but with an imaginative twist!  This classic puzzle has been expanded and reimagined into a unique and epic variation on an all-ages favorite!\n\nYOU KNOW HOW TO PLAY\nBut you don\u2019t!  TAC is played on a huge 3x3 grid called the Big Board.  Each of the nine squares are actually tic-tac-toe games of their own.  The gameplay in each of these squares, called the Little Boards, is familiar.  Players take turns placing either X\u2019s or O\u2019s in an effort to attain three in a row.\n\nTHE TWIST\nEvery turn is a strategic dance.  Each placement you make on the Little Board determines which square your opponent gets to move to on the Big Board.  You can either gain advantage on the Little Board or force your opponent to play in a certain square.  Move wisely!\n\nSCORE\nThere are two ways to win!  \n1)  Score three in a row on the Big Board!  If you win on a little board, it\u2019s like selecting a square on the big board.  If you succeed in lining up a trio of wins on the big board, you win!  \n2)  Dominate the big board!  If you earn more squares on the big board than your opponent, you win!\n\nChallenge your Facebook buddies or square off against strangers.  Take on an AI opponent and perfect your strategy.

Good ones encourage us and bad ones humble us.\n\nI am constantly fixing bugs that are brought up to me and trying to change things that bother people. It takes time since I am just one guy (Imago Software is only two guys) dealing with many issues. Still things will improve in future updates that I'm working on.\n\nMeanwhile, obviously this is a paid game and I don't want to disappoint or cheat people out of their money.\n\nHere's a gameplay video from TouchArcade's Sanuku (Thank you!):\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3O9tw2L5Wg&feature=plcp\n\nThis may help with your purchase decision! Also our own video that include game tutorials are at\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/Playimago\n\n@Matthew Haralson\nYes, the minor character development was very weak. More dialogs will be written in part of effort to more complete game experience!\n\n@Tony Peniyoung\nI was going to answer your concern but didn't really get the message!\n\n@Grievlocke\nWow, having big battle animations will be really cool. Number 1 in my wish list too. Simply there was no budget and it looks like there will be no budget in the future, either- looking at the sales.\n\n@Many who wanted more stages\nI had random map generation for more guild quests, but I couldn't get the quality right yet. Random really never worked with the element of strategy, and became just a brute fighting.\nPartia 2 was planned for 25 stages that wraps up the story, but at 600 games sold, well, I wonder if I could ever get enough budget.\n\n@ErnieBernie876\nI know it is not as convenient as having a restart button, but you could suspend the game and load the last save data to restart the stage from the beginning.\n\n@frozencracker\nIt would be a bug if you have an attack option without having a valid target, but I can't seem to reproduce it. To cancel the attack while targeting, you could press 'B' button (that's the inside button) or you could choose a target then select No.\n\nI will try my best to answer any question!

The full version of the game will unlock the rest of the worlds and allow you to email and share your programs and maps as well as open maps and programs that your friends and family send you so you can teach and learn from them as well!\n\nCato is a little boy who just like every little boy likes to go out and play. One fine day Cato was playing outside when a portal to another world opened up in front of him; a portal to another world! \n\nCato stepped through and discovered that this world unlike his own didn\'t follow the same rules. Every time he tried to take a step or an action he\'d find himself stuck in place. Stuck that is until he finally discovered the rules in this universe: by writing a program for himself he would be able to overcome all obstacles and learn something new along the way! \n\nFeatures: \n* Simple programming interface using beautiful cards with pictures \n* 59 levels and 10 tutorials (always working to add more!) \n* Powerful map editor so you can create your own maps and puzzles and share with friends \n* Preview your maps directly in the map editor to save time and test out your maps more quickly! \n* Saves program progress so you can pick up at any time and iteratively develop \n* Email your puzzle solutions to share your genius with others \n* Beautiful artwork and amusing sound effects and music \n* A manual to help guide parents and more interested users \n* Puzzles ranging from easy to hard to teach different programming concepts without trying to force them \n* Loops, branches and if/else, and simple memory using colored flags are the main tools used to introduce programming \n* Emailed maps include gorgeous screenshot of what you are sending so your friends know what to expect \n* Cato\'s Hike teaches children (ages 5+) the essentials of programming and how to think about solving complex problems \n* The challenges in there are solvable easily by children of all ages but more nuanced and complex solutions should challenge teenagers and parents alike! \n* Just a fun puzzle game :) \n\nUpcoming features: \n* MORE LEVELS! \n* Hints on harder levels \n* Possibly more tutorial levels if enough ask for it \n* Possible cloud-sync \n\nEssentially, \'Cato\u2019s Hike\' is a universal game for the iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch to teach kids and young children basic programming skills. The younger ones will obviously enjoy solving levels using simpler coding techniques but the hope is the older ones will pick up more advanced concepts like loops and branching as well as even more advanced concepts like a basic stack or memory! There is enough in here to keep everyone from children to parents engaged! More challenges are upcoming however so stay tuned! \n\nAs with all my projects I take this one very seriously and I hope you enjoy.

Use hex based tactical combat to dominate foes on the Russian front of the Second World War. Fight as the Germans or the Soviets in a series of ever more complex missions. The Eastern front of World War II saw some of the most ferocious fighting, as the Red Army and the Wehrmacht pitted ever more powerful tanks against each other. While the early years of the war saw the Soviets struggle to withstand the German Blitzkrieg, the later stages saw the Red Army counter-attack in great force. Missions vary from straightforward wipe out the enemy scenarios, to capturing key objectives, to protecting vital supply convoys and constructing bridges to assault the enemy. There are a whole range of objectives to reflect the tactical complexity of warfare on the Eastern Front, and conquer your enemy with over 110 historical units.

Each crab has a weapon shell--rock, paper or scissors. Your goal is to defeat the enemy crabs or capture their flag.\n\nThe rules are simple. Each turn, you move one of your crabs one space (up, down, left or right). When you defeat a crab you can choose to take over its weapon shell. This gives you strategic options. No stat charts or skill trees or complicated rule sets to memorize. It's simple-to-learn yet difficult-to-master.\n\nIncludes local multiplayer (2 to 4 players). The next time your friends challenge you to a game of rock-paper-scissors, play a game of Crabby Coast instead.\n\nThis is a premium, pay-once-and-play game. No ads or in-app purchases. Relax to the sound of the ocean knowing you won't be bothered by ads or timers.

It's not about the war game or any other shooter games, its literally about painting the ball. There is a given pattern of colored balls and some pipes around them. You are given an amount of paint color to draw and change the color of any of the balls in the scene trying to match 3, 4 or 5 balls near a pipe, this way the pipes suck these matched balls and new paint is given to you. The gameplay is very different from the well known and cloned match 3 swapping candy fluffy games like candy crush soda and candy crush saga games. Try it and you'll get hooked.\n\n\u2022 Game Objective:\nYou have to make groups of 3 or more balls of the same color. These groups must be made next to a pipe. Paint balls by tapping on them. When you click on the ball you wish to paint, the ball changes color and the group gets sucked into the pipe.\n\n\u2022 Tips:\nUsing the same pipe makes it hot. If a pipe becomes extra hot the balls are transformed into multi-color which gives you extra points & life. Letters appear on some balls. When balls are grouped, the letter taken, complete the word 'PaintBall' on the bottom. When all word is completed a big bonus is earned!\n\n\u2022 Hard: The Hard game works exactly like the Easy game, but you have to play fast because your paint reserve is dripping! If it runs out, you lose.\n\u2022 Panic: In Panic mode you have 100 sec. to score as much as possible. This is not all! Your paint reserve is dripping & there are no black balls. This makes it easier to make groups.\n\u2022 Heat: In this mode, ball groups are taken only when they are next to a hot (red) pipe. Each time this happens active (red) pipes are moved. There are no black balls, which makes it easier to make groups. This mode needs planning!\n\u2022 Chroma: In the Chroma mode you will have to play using color combinations e.g.: if you have yellow paint & the ball you want to paint is blue. Blue and yellow will be: Green. Use the color wheel to keep track. If you mix opposite colors you get black.\n\nFEATURES\n* award winning gameplay\n* hours of gameplay craziness - mania guaranteed\n* many modes to play\n* fast playing ideal for waiting rooms/buses\n* Export Hi-Scores to internet\n* change ball styles\n\nPRESS:\n-----\nUIQ 2008 Open Winner for the games category! \n-----\ngamefreaks365: So, do you need Paintball 2?
