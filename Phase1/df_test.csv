This plundering is illustrated by the overlaying of a colored banner (called ""vests"") on the piece that made the capture.  Image illustrations provided.\n\n2) The added moving capability provided by a plundered vest may be used one time only on any future move.  (I.e., the plundered vest may be used on it\'s very next move or carried around on the board and used later in the game, but only once.)\n\n3) Plundering is optional and may be declined by the player making the capture.  YES, sometimes you do NOT want to plunder a vest from the spoils of the kill!!  The case for NOT plundering would be if you suspect your opponent will immediately capture you back (making a ""trade"") and acquire the vest you just plundered!  (See rule #9)\n\n4) When plundering is elected, a ""colored vest banner"" that corresponds to the moving capabilities being plundered, gets overlaid upon the chess piece that made the kill.  This vest banner signifies to both players that the piece wearing it now has extra moving capabilities for one future move.","White Horse Games, LLC",4+,EN,29162496,Games,"Games, Board, Entertainment, Strategy",2014-02-18,2016-03-04,4.5,0.0207,0.9565,0.6884874999999999

Each Colony is further subdivided into areas over which factions will struggle for control. A faction holds control of a Colony when only units of its side are present in the areas of a Colony. Player controlled factions include the Continental Army, Patriot Militia, British Regulars and Loyalist Militia. In addition to this the Allied French and Allied Hessian factions, which are controlled by American and British forces respectively, can be brought into the game by event cards playable by each faction. \n\nEach game is played in a series of rounds. Victory conditions are checked for each side starting on round three and each game ends with victory points being tallied automatically on round eight if no one has won before then. Each round is subdivided into four turns, one for each side, which happen in order determined by a blind draw of the turn marker for each faction. It is entirely possible for a faction to go last in a previous round only to go first in the next. \n\nMovement & Events \n\nEvery Faction has a deck of cards consisting of Event cards, Movement cards, and one Truce card. Every turn, each faction will play a movement card to maneuver their troops and any number of event cards. When both factions of a side (British or American) have played their truce cards, the game will end! Each deck has a specific number of movement cards in it and managing them is an important part of the game. \n\nEach faction has a Truce card which serves not only as a timer for the game but as a powerful Movement card. However, a game may end prematurely if both factions of a side are forced to play it early in the game.\n\nNote: We recommend playing on an iPhone 5S, iPad Mini 2, iPad Air, iPad Pro or newer device.",HexWar Games Ltd,12+,EN,323195904,Games,"Games, Strategy, Board",2016-11-03,2017-08-01,4.0,-0.4019,0.9833,0.6785666666666667

To their amazement they discovered extensive resources on a strange planet far off of even the largest star maps. It contained precious exotic minerals whose energy levels were off the chart. This was earths answer. BIOSPHERE immediately started mining in anticipation of the prosperity and promise that the minerals could have for Earth. However, APEX saw the minerals as a highly lucrative business opportunity and promptly declared ownership of the planet and its vast resources. They ruthlessly engaged BIOSPHERE\u2019s forces intent on wiping them out. Only one corporation will make it back to Earth alive.

It uses fluid touch controls that are aimed for simplicity and ease of use. Classic old-school resource collection mechanics are favored as well as simple clear graphics. There are a number of customized mechs you can build as well as various structures. There are also a handful of upgrades that you can utilize which can mean the difference between victory and defeat against a clever and challenging AI. Finally there are a large number of maps (zones) to choose from for Custom Games or you can go with a Ranked Game where the computer matches you to your skill level depending on your rank and how many promotion points you have earned to keep you challenged.\n\n=== How To Play ===\nGameplay primarily consists of building individual units and structures on build pads. You build a refinery to harvest minerals and convert them to money. You then use the money to build a broad assortment of unit components, upgrades and an assortment of structures such as an Armory to unlock multiple component upgrades (also costing money) and a turret for example. Once you create your army, you can converge on the map to take control of Beacons where you can deploy more units. Capturing and keeping Beacons is vital in making your way across the map. Engage and eliminate all opponent units and structures to be declared the victor. \n\n=== Game Features ===\n\u2022  Basic Tutorial.\n\u2022  Challenging AI.\n\u2022  Simple 3D graphics.\n\u2022  7 Ranks to progress though.\n\u2022  Simple large touch controls.\n\u2022  12 maps set in 3 different landscapes.\n\u2022  NO ADS OR IN-APP PURCHASES EVER!\n\u2022  Old-school resources collection system.\n\u2022  2 game modes (Ranked Game and Custom Game).\n\u2022  16 unique combinations of mechs PLUS UPGRADES!\n\n=== Game Tips ===\n\u2022  Strongest is not always best.\n\u2022  Upgrades and key to victory.\n\u2022  Hover chassis can go over water and works great for scouts.\n\u2022  Speed is important.

The last bastion of hope for Earth, E-CON operates out of vast militarised caverns and tries it's utmost to find a way to wrestle control of Earth back from the Insectron invaders.\n\n** Aliens: Insectron **\nThe basis for all Insectron 'life' are two substances believed to be based on highly advanced nanomachines.  The first substance, labelled 'Xenoaqua', is a quicksilver like substance which hardens to create Insectron structures and armour.  It is highly adaptable and will self-repair by absorbing more liquid Xenoaqua.  The second substance is 'Xenophy', a purple liquid, said to have the consistency of thick syrup.  Xenophy is thought to be the 'brains' inside the Insectron machines and the most vulnerable to damage.  It is unknown if the Insectron think with a' hivemind' or if they feel individuality, but both there is evidence to support both claims.  The Insectrons follow a pack mentality to the point they seem to share their perceptions on the battlefield almost instantaneously, they also display fear and self-survival when in danger.\n\n** Martians: The Holy Gravidus Republic (HGR) **\nHumans first settled on Mars midway into the 22nd century. Isolated for hundreds of years, the Colony on Mars grew into a religious order. While Earth burned for decades, the Insectron horde sent a much smaller force to occupy Mars; and while the Martians and Insectrons clashed, the Martian people were left relatively unhindered in their progress. Waiting for the perfect moment, the HTR have unleashed the full potential of their technology, wiping aside the Insectron occupation force.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/partia-3/id969233809,969233809,Partia 3,SRPG,icons/2208.png,12,6.99,,"""Partia 3 is a SRPG (Strategy Role-playing) video game inspired by Fire Emblem and Tear Ring Saga series. In a high fantasy setting, the game will take players through an adventure where magic and sword collide and friendship and betrayal intertwine.\n\nPartia 3 : The Knight of Partia is the third installment of the Partia series that wraps up the 'Granian Trilogy'. However, the game is designed as a stand-alone set in hundreds of years after the events of Partia 2, hence no knowledge of the prior games is required.\n\nThe game includes 30 stages (including 5 hidden stages) that should provide solid 30 plus hours of game play if not 50 or 100.\n\nIt is not a graphically good looking game nor has the big sprite animated battles that Fire Emblem games have. UI can be a bit clunky and looks 'meh', in most places at best.\n\nBut if there's any labor of love, this must be it. Despite the financial failures of the first two Partia games, I kept on making this game, alone for five years, putting all my free times and vacations into, because frankly I was obsessed about finishing off this thing.\n\nBut I've had a lot of fun making it, and I still had more fun playing the game myself. I'm sure you will have some joy out of it, if you are a fan of Fire Emblem and Tear Ring Saga series.\n\nNow mobile game landscape has changed a lot since I started out this journey back in 2011. There are now a lot of quality games in the App store, including a Fire Emblem itself!\nI realized a few years ago I no longer served any good value to customers who were looking for a little SRPG experience on mobile. As I'm writing this, Partia 2 sold slightly more than 2K units in 5 years. So obviously this is not a money making venture, of which I hope my next idea is going to be, unlike this Partia thing.\n\nAnyways, the result is a paid game, with no ad, no IAP, and no catch anywhere. I'm not even tracking any data as, frankly I don't see a point in doing that. You see I am already resigned to the fate this little big indie game is for the lovers only.\n\nFor The Lovers Only.\n\nSo this may be the final time I write a game description on an App Store. Or maybe not.\n\nWhoever you are, I hope you enjoy. If you can, please let me know how you find your experience.\n\nThank you!\n\nDustin""",Imago Software,9+,EN,139576320,Games,"Games, Strategy, Role Playing",2019-01-21,2019-07-29,4.5,-0.957,0.9969,0.6074461538461537

Will your efforts help bring democracy to Eastern Europe, or will you provoke the Soviet Union to bring down its wrath, setting the cause of freedom back by decades? \n\nThis is a strategy game about presidential decision-making in the context of the Bush 41 presidency in those epochal years of 1989 and 1990.

Kakuro is one of the top logic puzzles worldwide, appearing in printed newspapers, magazines, books, and numerous software implementations for smartphones, tablets and computers.\xa0\n\nWhether you are new to Kakuro or an experienced player currently using another app, you owe it to yourself to download and try Art of Kakuro. The app was designed to make the experience of playing Kakuro on a mobile device more efficient and enjoyable than anything else available. For example, in other Kakuro apps, adding notes to indicate what digits are possible in a row or column is annoyingly tedious. Art of Kakuro makes this far faster and easier by allowing multiple selections, and by allowing dragging across the number input buttons to enter multiple consecutive digits. As a result, entering notes for a row of three spaces with a sum of 10 takes 2 tap-and-swipe gestures instead of 24 taps. Advantages like these will make other apps seem frustrating once you\'ve used Art of Kakuro!\n\nArt of Kakuro also offers unparalleled choice in gameplay and appearance. There are a number of input control schemes used in various Kakuro apps, but only Art of Kakuro gives YOU the choice, with 11 input control variations available. Options for color scheme, background image and font allow you to find a style that looks good to YOU - and to change it periodically to keep it fresh. Portrait and landscape orientations are fully supported on both iPhones and iPads, once again giving YOU the choice of holding your device as you want.\n\nDownload it today and see for yourself why Art of Kakuro is the premier Kakuro experience for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nFeatures:\n\u2022 Unlimited puzzle generation of 4x4 to 9x9 puzzles (including non-square sizes) at three levels of difficulty\n\u2022 Selectable colors, font and background image\n\u2022 ""Hints"" can walk you through solving a puzzle when you get stuck - not merely filling in a number, but actually explaining the logic\n\u2022 Undo\n\u2022 Sound effects\n\u2022 Show number combinations for the selected row and column\n\u2022 Multiple input control options\n\u2022 Easy to read numbers (in case your eyesight is not as sharp as your mind!)\n\u2022 Universal app, optimized for both iPhone and iPad\n\u2022 Supports portrait and landscape use\n\u2022 Replay games to see if you improve\n\u2022 See your ""solving speed"" in digits per hour\n\u2022 Localized to English, Japanese, Chinese, Portuguese and Spanish",Kevin Brain,4+,"EN, JA, PT, ZH, ES",4214784,Games,"Games, Strategy, Puzzle, Entertainment",2014-04-24,2015-06-09,4.5,0.8658,0.9814,0.9236

An IQ level indicates how one is positioned compared to the majority of individuals in a given age bracket.\n\nThe application ""IQ Test: Calculate your IQ"" includes:\n\n*A free test of 10 questions :\nThis 10-question IQ test is based exclusively on logic. It will allow you to evaluate your capacity for reasoning, determine the range of your overall intelligence, and give you a fast estimation of your IQ level.\n\n*Two 50-question IQ tests : (paid)\nThe tests we offer were carefully prepared to evaluate the intelligence level of individuals. Psychologists supervised them preparation.\nYou will be able to calculate your IQ, compare your performance to the rest of the population and receive a detailed analysis of your intelligence.\nThis report gives a detailed assessment of your strengths and weaknesses in the four identified dimensions (verbal, logical, mathematical and spatial intelligence).\n\n*A 50-question IQ test for children aged between 8 and 14 years old. : (paid)\nThe test we offer had been carefully prepared by a psychologist for children aged between 8 and 14 years old. \nIt will allow you to evaluate your intelligence level in four key areas, namely: logic, arithmetic, vocabulary and comprehension.\nThis test was developed especially for children between the ages of 8 and 14 under the supervision of an English-speaking child psychologist. \nIt includes questions that correspond precisely to each age group concerned (8-9 years-old, 10-11 years-old, 12-13 years-old and 14 years-old), and, therefore, in order to obtain an accurate evaluation, it is important to declare the child\'s actual age right at the start of the test. \n\n*The IQ Expert challenge : (paid)\nThis test is intended for high IQ individuals (above 110) \nThe ""expert"" version of the standard IQ test was developed to enable respondents whose IQs are above average (normative IQ score is approximately 104) to take this new and somewhat challenging assessment without answering the same questions usually encountered in IQ tests. \nThis IQ Expert test challenges respondents because it includes questions slightly more difficult than those found in the more traditional IQ tests. \n\nHow to take this test:\n1. You have exactly 35 minutes to answer the 50 questions that follow. A countdown will begin as soon as you start the test and begins again each time the contents of the succeeding page are fully displayed.\n2. You cannot use a calculator, but pen and paper are permitted.\n3. Answer all questions and, if you are not able to, guess the answer. Intuitive responses are taken into account in the general evaluation.\n4. If a question seems to suggest more than a single answer among the given choices, select the one that appears most obvious or more ""reasonable"" to you.\n5. If a youngster of less than 15 years of age wants to take part in an IQ test, we strongly suggest that he/she takes the test for children rather than the regular IQ test. \nIt has been carefully prepared by a psychologist for children aged between 8 and 14 years old.\n\nWhat our users say:\n\nHi, thanx. I really had no problem taking the test. I\'m very satisfied with the results. I\'m really happy that I came off so intelligently! \nI feel truly confident and I had fun with it besides.

Very few, unless you\u2019re talking about DodgeDot\u2122! What on earth can make a game so simple, yet so compelling and addictive? Why is the DodgeDot\u2122 player community so fanatic and dedicated?\n\nDodgeDot\u2122 is truly a game for everybody with players around the world from 2 years old to in their nineties. With over 22 miliion games played to date, it\u2019s incredibly simple to play. DodgeDot\u2122\u2019s basic rules can be described in less than a minute and many players learn the basics just by jumping in and quickly discovering them by trial and error. It\'s a game that can be played at a gentle and relaxing pace and yet also provides plenty of challenges for players that want to develop their dexterity, playing strategy, and overall game skills for competition. \nDodgeDot\u2122 is elegantly simple, yet produces infinitely rich gameplay:\n\n- Drag the moving colored dots to matching goals to score points\n- Clear all moving dots from field to advance to the next level\n- Avoid colliding with dots of different colors\n- Avoid contacting unmatched goals of different colors\n- Join dots of the same color to earn bonus points\n\nThe nature of the game\'s dynamics are infinitely variable, with its dots moving in different directions and speeds, and with time and every player interaction affecting the subsequent dot movement patterns and point values.\n\nDodgeDot\u2122 is also a visually pleasing game of colors.  Choose your favorite four-color schemes to play with, from a large selection of palettes.\n\n- New Game Rounds with fresh starting patterns for Levels automatically start every Monday!\n\n- Built in leaderboard network where you can have your own profile, see rank listings for players, friend other players,etc.\n\n- All registered Jampaq Network players have an opportunity to compete for fresh rankings every week!\n\n- Supports Apple\'s Game Center for high score leaderboard!\n \n- This is a universal application, so buy it for iPhone/iPod Touch and you can also install it on your iPad!\n\n*** WAS FEATURED ON Apple\'s ""WHAT\'S HOT"" LIST! ***\n\nDON\'T FORGET TO JOIN THE JAMPAQ NETWORK!\nREGISTRATION\'S FREE & SIMPLE IN-APP!\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \nWatch videos at: \nhttp://www.youtube.com/dodgedot \n\nHere\u2019s what DodgeDot\u2122 players have to say:\n\n\u201cTotal Addiction!!!!  It\u2019s hard to put it down.... The game is mesmerizing\u2026. I have come to the conclusion that the best games in the App Store are those that concentrate more on the gameplay and concept, and less on having the fanciest, largest game around. My favorite games are the simplest and most elegant \u2026 and DodgeDot\u2122 tops the list\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been playing DodgeDot\u2122 for over 3 years and still enjoy it as much as I did then. If people would only try it, they would be pleasantly surprised why it\u2019s such a great game that\u2019s hard to put down\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is truly one of the few games I absolutely cannot bring myself to delete, no matter how low I become on memory. This is a definite must buy!!!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is great for all ages (at age 63, I should know) and the video instructions are beautifully done. \u2026worth way more than you\u2019re payin\u2019. As a retired teacher, I view this as a fantastic opportunity to both develop... and retain thinking skills. These folks put a lot of thought into development and execution! Don\u2019t pass it up!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis game has all the makings of a timeless classic. I find myself always coming back to DodgeDot\u2122.\u201d\n\n""Soooooooo Addicting.

I have played SHG games for years. Best one yet ... awesome job guys!! \n\n-Wicked Space Game If you like SyFy then you should enjoy this game.\n\n-Addictive and full of hidden depths This is a simple game. Or so it seems at first, the gameplay is remarkably easy to get your fingers around (playing on a phone, that\'s an important feature). But what becomes addictive is not the simple play, but the depth of story that has been crafted.\n\n-Fun Stuff!! What an adventurous involving time I had playing Zombie Moon. Love the sounds and customizing my marine to do in the zombies. \n\nReview from one of the Game Creators\nAs one of the game creators, and player too, I love Zombie Moon and glad others are as well!  It\'s the mobile evolution of the existing www.starpirates.net, www.spybattle.com & www.gatesofcamelot.com.  It\'s actually in the same universe at, roughly, the same time.  The gameplay is streamlined as the mobile experience (and screensize!) leads to a different style of play.  For me, it works. \n\nI love the storyline that comes out through the Missions feature.  There is a mystery involved, and that unrolls through the Missions.  \n\nThe game is free; you really don\'t have to pay to play, nor give Snakehead private info, to continue.\n\nI love being part of an awesome Snakehead Games community that loves our games.  \n \n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFor news and updates follow us on social media:\n\nZombie Moon Twitter  https://twitter.com/zombiemoongame\n\nZombie Moon Facebook https://www.facebook.com/ZombieMoonMobile\n\n\nMORE REVIEWS\n\n- FANTASTIC -- This is the very first game I have played on my phone.

If so, then Tank Ace 1944 could be the game for you.\n\nIn Tank Ace 1944 you command a World War II tank charging to occupy the enemy capitol. Allied and Soviet Tank Aces advance on Berlin; German Aces advance on London and Moscow. At least that's what the orders from HQ say. But since you face overwhelming odds and are forced to scavenge supplies as you go, you might just find yourself retreating instead.\n\nThe goal of each round of play is to clear the enemy from a map sector and drive them off the far bank of a river so that your side can cross and advance. Skills you will need to accomplish this are a working trigger finger, the ability to navigate West or East (left and right on the overhead map), and driving ability sufficient to crash into other vehicles.\n\nA status panel shows the number of enemies left, rounds remaining, fuel, and armor strength. The last three can be replenished by ramming (not shooting) an enemy truck. If you run out of fuel or armor, or for some reason drive your tank into the water, in addition to an untimely death you will be forced to retreat one sector. If you wipe out the enemies you will advance one sector, retaining any excess supplies you have scavenged. The game ends when you take the enemy capitol, or they overrun yours. Either way the brass will want to have a talk with you.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Play one of three aces: Allied, German, or Soviet.\n- Three tanks: Sherman, Tiger, or T34, each with movable turret and cannon.\n- Destroyable 3D landscape.\n- Perspective or overhead view.\n- Three difficulty settings.\n- Enemy trucks carrying rounds, fuel, and armor.\n- Save / Resume game.\n\nThis is the free Lite version with ads and limited supplies.

Multiplis,Multiplication made fun,icons/1778.png,31,3.99,,"""Winner of Editor's Choice Award - Children's Technology Review and Parent's Choice Award!  \n\nWhat are people saying? \n\u201cMt. Multiplis is not just focused on getting the answer, but also understanding the process of multiplication and the strategies that kids need to develop. I love how this app supports my students\u2019 thinking in a way no other app does.\u201d - Alana S., K-5 Special Education Teacher\n\n\u201cI really like how Mt. Multiplis combines the area model and the number line. It\u2019s helped my students demonstrate their understanding across representations.\u201d - Yvette B., 3rd grade teacher\n\nAbout the game:\nLinka gets caught in a terrible storm while flying home after a successful treasure hunt. She escapes but her plane isn\u2019t as lucky. Help Linka make her way through Mt. Multiplis by building bridges, unlocking treasure, and earning gems. Rebuild Linka\u2019s plane by collecting the pieces from the greedy Crags who live on the island.   \n\nDeveloped by teachers and experts in children\u2019s cognition and learning, Mt. Multiplis is an engaging game that teaches multiplication through the commutative and distributive properties. While most multiplication apps focus on drill with digital worksheets and flashcards, Mt. Multiplis scaffolds learning to promote conceptual understanding, efficiency with multiplication strategies, and fact fluency. \n\nThe Common Core State Standards expect third graders to use the distributive property when multiplying (CCSM.3.OA.B.5): \u201cKnowing that 8 \xd7 5 = 40 and 8 \xd7 2 = 16, one can find 8 \xd7 7 as 8 \xd7 (5 + 2) = (8 \xd7 5) + (8 \xd7 2) = 40 + 16 = 56.\u201d Mt. Multiplis is designed to make this complex content more approachable and fun for kids. Students can think strategically, seeing how 7 x 8 is the same as 5 groups of 8 plus 2 more groups of 8.\n\nSupports Response to Intervention programs:\nMt. Multiplis is a great tool for classroom teachers looking to differentiate instruction for students. The app is also great for parents who want to support their children\u2019s learning. \n \nRecommended Grades: 3rd-5th (6th-8th intervention)\n\nMeets Common Core Math Standards: \n-3.OA.A.1   -3.OA.A.3   -3.OA.A.7   -3.OA.B.5\n\nAbout Teachley: \nFounded by former teachers, Teachley uses cognitive science research to create apps that teach effective learning strategies and assess what kids know within engaging games.

Crowntakers is a PDL TBS RPG (that is, a procedural death labyrinth role-playing game with turn-based strategy combat) (\u2026) and it\u2019s really good fun if you like games like Final Fantasy Tactics.\u201c\nMichelle Star, CNET\n\n\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\nUser Ratings\n\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\n\n5/5 - If you like turn based tactical medieval rpg's get this. Not as much story/length as final fantasy tactics, but frankly on iDevices I consider that a win. Bite sized battles, winnable in a day on easy, challenging on hard, good replay value. Only crashed once on 1st gen mini\n\n5/5 - This is worth your money. You get a polished game, tactical battles, and thoughtful choices in exploration. Also big points for splitting the game into two difficulties. One being sort of roguelike with permadeath and the other much more RPG without permadeath and with consistent leveling. If you're thinking about this one, you'll probably thoroughly enjoy it like I do!\n\n5/5 - This game should get much more hype. I've been playing it non-stop in my free time for over a week. Despite some bugs (which the dev's have been very quick to address), Each game feels quite different with the random locations within areas, random loot and different party builds. It's not easy at first, but learning different strategies as you go is enjoyable. Highly recommend this game!\n\n5/5 - Big fan of this game. The battles are very tactical and the map navigation is really streamlined and fun to explore. This is a good one for any rogue-like fans. It's not super punishing, but it does present a nice challenge on the normal mode (haven't beaten it yet, but I hope a hard mode unlocks after doing so).""",Kalypso Media Group GmbH,12+,"EN, FR, DE, IT, JA, KO, RU, ZH, ES, ZH",693882880,Games,"Games, Role Playing, Strategy",2015-03-31,2017-04-03,4.5,-0.8513,0.9464,0.4420666666666666

Although its offensive power was extremely high, the defensive ability was poor. \n\nSince no one knew how to utilize this war potential at that time, there might be \nvarious possibilities in the short term.\n\nAs a commander of the air craft carrier task force, make strategic decisions and lead your task force to the victory.\n\nIn this game, you will play the following important roles in the every layer.\n\n 1) Commander of aircraft carrier task force  - Make a Decision\n 2) Captain of aircraft carrier  \u2013 Maneuver your aircraft carrier \n 3) Pilot of Search Plane \u2013 Search Enemy\u2019s aircraft task force\n 4) Leader of Torpedo Attack Group  - Attack enemy aircraft by torpedoes\n 5) Leader of Bomber Attack Group  - Attack enemy aircraft by dive bombs\n 6) Leader of Intercept Fighter Group \u2013 Intercept enemy attack group\n\n1. Features\n\n 1) Every event is realized in the Real-Time simulation.\n 2) Player plays important roles in every layer.\n 3) There are many functions for shorten game time. \n 4) Tutorial Battle is avairable.\n\n2.

Major changes\n\nFor making this game more interesting, following items are modified from the real feature.\n\n 1) New aircraft carrier can be revived easily.\n 2) Aircraft on aircraft carrier is always fully carried when the carrier joins the battle.\n 3) New technologies like Rader, VT-fuse, Break-Code, etc, are not introduced.\n 4) The difference of the ability such as carriers, aircrafts, etc is not considered.\n\n4.

One fine day Cato was playing outside when a portal to another world opened up in front of him; a portal to another world! \n\nCato stepped through and discovered that this world unlike his own didn\'t follow the same rules.

The younger ones will obviously enjoy solving levels using simpler coding techniques but the hope is the older ones will pick up more advanced concepts like loops and branching as well as even more advanced concepts like a basic stack or memory! There is enough in here to keep everyone from children to parents engaged! More challenges are upcoming however so stay tuned! \n\nAs with all my projects I take this one very seriously and I hope you enjoy.

Even the simplest inferencing can be difficult for some children. Children begin to make observations when they can see something happening. In contrast, inferences are what they figure out based on an experience or relating to an experience, which is more abstract. Helping students understand when information is implied, or not directly stated, will improve their skills in drawing conclusions, making inferences/predictions, reasoning, problem solving, logic, critical thinking, cognitive skills and even social skills. Special needs students can benefit greatly from gaining inferencing abilities in this motivating format which provides the building blocks for more difficult inferencing.\n\nThese skills will be needed for all types of school assignments, including reading, science, social studies and many other subjects, as well as life in general. Inferential thinking is a complex skill that will develop over time and with experience. Questions may ask why a person may have responded as he did or what the child thinks will happen next. Because young children are quite literal, this is often very difficult and they have to \u201cread between the lines.\u201d\n\nQuestions are presented in a game format, giving the student the opportunity to choose the best answer, that would make the most logical sense, given the details provided.
