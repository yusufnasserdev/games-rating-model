But this is going to change in Mars Tomorrow. Humans inhabited the once hostile to life planet and took care of turning it into a green and habitable place. By terraforming, Mars is becoming a planet for the new Martians.\nFrom red to green\n\nIn the game Mars Tomorrow your aim is the colonizing the planet in order to transform it into a green planet. The player takes the role of a brave colonist. With the Earth being anything but habitable, the player has to try his luck as a Martian. The settlement project is called Mars Tomorrow and is the beginning of the operation \u2018Life on Mars\u2019 and let you start colonizing Mars with other new Martians.\nThe birth of their own colony\n\nHowever, general living conditions are hardly met on Mars as it is. The red planet seems to be bleak and arid - not even grass grows in the dreary wasteland. At the beginning of your mission you need to gather resources, which are urgently needed for the colonization of Mars. These include water, oxygen and carbon dioxide. Once this is done, all the raw materials are used to produce vital products. The Mars Rovers take care of the transportation to the colony, which will grow over time. As your colony grows, more and more people will decide to settle on Mars. The new residents of the colony help in increasing the colony and a thriving economy will soon be established. Once the economy grows, greenhouse gases are emitted, forming an Earth-like atmosphere. The resulting clouds, rain, rivers, lakes and algae enable the transformation of a formerly red to a green planet.\nProspering economy\n\nAt first glance, Mars Tomorrow appears as a simple building game. However, with increasing population comes a significant increase in the challenges of the economic simulation part of the game. All tasks must be coordinated, so that the economy does not collapse and the survival of the population can be ensured. Once the Mars Rover brought the resources to the colony, terraforming is performed. The larger the population, the more resources are needed. The player is faced with the question: How to master both, economic and environmental difficulties. At first, every Martian only controls a few Mars Rovers, which can be improved by ""plug-ins"". The Mars itself changes every ten days, so the player is faced with many new challenges. Overall, there are eight phases that ultimately give the planet its green appearance and enabling Earth-like conditions on Mars. In each phase, there is also a new type of vehicle.\nTogether for a better life\n\nLife on Mars is not designed by a player alone, but together with several players to experience and enjoy the game together, which makes the game very communicative. Certain resources supply the player Terra points. At the end of a round they will be compared with the points of the other players. The player with the highest Terra point score wins the round. However, not only the winner of a round receives a goodie. The best players of each round will be able to win Tritium, which will be added directly into their account at the beginning of the new round. In the world of Mars Tomorrow Tritium is eventually used to buy settlers accounts, plug-ins and much more.

The hard part was to make a simple strategy game that is cut down to the most core strategic elements. It was exciting to try and convert the feeling from strategy board games into a real time experience. Unfortunately, it is not practical to have real time strategy games without digital assistance, so the iPad was chosen as optimal platform for this experiment. \nI wanted the game to feature recognizable elements from normal strategy games: \n- Upgrading (tap and hold star)\n- Attack (send out comets towards enemy star)\n- Defense (send out comets against incoming enemy comets)\n- Resource management (balancing attack, defense and upgrading)\n- Tactics (choose an unpredictable route for your comets or make a timing attack when opponent is weak after upgrading)\n\nGood luck - have fun!\nPlease support us by leaving a review, if you like the game :)""",jan borg,4+,EN,47596544,Games,"Games, Board, Strategy, Entertainment",10/11/2015,10/11/2015,Intermediate

Play single- or double-deck with configurable options including meld bids and shoot the moon. Pinochle Plus is updated frequently with user-suggested features and AI improvements. To try before you buy, see our free, ad-supported Pinochle app. If you prefer, our other pinochle app with no advertising, Pinochle Gold, has more card backs and tabletops to choose from, and adds support for several languages.\n\nPinochle is a card game played with a 48- or 80-card deck of 9s, 10s, jacks, queens, kings and aces. The game consists of a repeating sequence of bidding (for the right to name the trump suit and optionally to pass cards), melding, and trick-taking. Players score points by melding various card combinations and by taking tricks.\n\nIn this version, one human player (South) plays with a computer partner (North) and two computer opponents (West and East).\n\nBIDDING: Each player bids the number of points she thinks she can make with her hand. Player to the dealer's left is required to bid, and bidding proceeds to the left. Players who pass are out of the bidding for that hand. A typical high bid is 35 points (for 48 cards) or 60 (for 80 cards). High bidder names the trump suit for the hand and optionally exchanges cards with her partner.\n\nMELDING: Players get points by showing various card combinations. A run (or straight) in the trump suit is worth 15 points. Aces in all four suits is 10 points. Pinochle (queen of spades and jack of diamonds) is 4 points, or 30 points for double pinochle (two of each).\n\nTRICKS: Play begins with the high bidder, and proceeds around the table to the left, 4 cards per trick. Each trick has a winner, who gets 1 point per ace, ten or king.\n\nSCORING: If the high bidder fails to make the bid (his team's total meld plus trick points is less than the bid), the bid amount is subtracted from the team score. Play continues until one team goes out.""",fishdog.net,4+,"EN, DE",43512832,Games,"Games, Card, Entertainment, Strategy",20/12/2009,2/8/2019,Intermediate

The funny thing is, you love every second of it.\n\nJust imagine training your brain and relaxing at the same time.

You can definitely do this and have a ton of fun while you\u2019re at it.\n\nThe idea is to eliminate bits. You start the first game with primary bits. Select one and all possible moves are revealed to you. Okay, start jumping the neighboring bits until there is only one left. There are instances when combined bits will occur and that just adds a new, interesting dimension to the game. But pay attention that the bits don't get stuck. \n\nWhen you get down to one bit, WORP HD starts calculating and opens another memory for you to continue on with. Check out the screen shots to see what further challenges WORP HD has to offer. \n\nMade a mistake? Don\u2019t worry, just click the Undo button and try again. You might have to do that more than once.

You are going to be totally immersed in this game.\n\nFeatures\n- 9 different memories of increasing difficulty\n- 3 difficulty levels \u2013 beginner, intermediate and advanced \u2013 for each of the 9 memories\n- Atmospheric sound design by Konsorten\u2122\n- Interrupt any time via the Home button \u2013 resume where you left off\n- Undo all moves even after resuming a game\n\nShow yourself what you and your brain can do.

Rules are simple and intuitive enough for kids to play easily, yet there is more than enough strategic depth to satisfy the most demanding gamer. If you enjoy challenging games like Chess, Checkers, Go, or Shogi, discover Arimaa and see why it was chosen in the Discovery Channel's list of the Top 10 Mind-bending Strategy Games and also recommended by Scientific American MIND magazine.\n\n\u201cThe rules are simple enough for kids to learn, and the game was creative and engaging.\u201d \n\u2014Frederik Joelving; Scientific American Mind magazine\n\nWith millions of opening setups to choose from, every game requires creative thinking right from the beginning and no need to memorize openings. It's a never ending puzzle, each game is different. In just the first 10 moves of Arimaa there's more possible games than there are atoms in our universe.\n\n\u201cBecause the number of possible moves in an Arimaa position (roughly 20,000) is much higher than in chess (about 30 or so), even the fastest computers will not be able to search very far into the tree of possibilities.\u201d \n\u2014R. Wayne Schmittberger; GAMES magazine\n\nArimaa provides the whole family a chance to show the computer who's boss. Many games boast of the strength of their computer AI, but Arimaa requires a higher level of intelligence which humans possess and computers have yet to achieve. In fact Arimaa offers a $10,000 prize for anyone capable of writing an AI that can defeat the top human Arimaa players. Visit www.arimaa.com for more details.\n\nThis Arimaa app includes a video tutorial to teach the rules of the game making it easy to get started. There are increasing levels of difficulty to help you build your skill, and a score to let you know how well you played. Try beating the AI faster or by losing fewer pieces to top your high score. The app is loaded with features and settings to help you learn this addictive new game.\n \nFeatures: \n\u2022 video tutorial to teach the rules \n\u2022 several difficulty levels \n\u2022 ability to play handicap games \n\u2022 keep track of high scores \n\u2022 keep track of ratings \n\u2022 mode to pass and play with a friend \n\u2022 option to auto-rotate the board between moves \n\u2022 option to auto-rotate the game between moves \n\u2022 option to pause between moves \n\u2022 option to play rated games \n\u2022 option to use a move timer \n\u2022 ability to load and save games \n\u2022 ability to email the game \n\u2022 ability to replay a game from any position\n\u2022 dedicated full screen mode for iPad\n\nAwards and Recognition: \n\u2022 Scientific American MIND magazine: Brainy gift recommendation \n\u2022 Discovery Channel's HowStuffWorks: Selected as 3rd most mind-bending game \n\u2022 Parents Choice: Approved award \n\u2022 Creative Child magazine: 2010 Game of the Year\n\nThis app is provided in compliance with Section 2 of the Arimaa Public License.

Your task is to find and match identical tiles and clear the board. It's not as simple as it sounds, because some tiles are blocked you must try to move tiles that will unblock more tiles. \n\nThe challenge in Mahjong is to not end up with an unsovable board, so carefully plan your moves before picking tiles to match. Some moves will free more tiles and that is usually (but not always) a good move. Some moves may cause the board to be unsovable (because all tiles are blocked), but in this situation we provide a couple of Shuffle option to reset the board to a solvable state (the exception is when only 2 tiles are remaining and they're on top of each other).\n\nOver 50 board layout (levels) configurations, all free to play, including the classic/traditional turtle/pyramid board layout/tower. Some of the stacks has epic number of tiles (300+) which should provide plenty of challenge for Mahjong fans. Tile positions on the game boards are placed randomly on every board level - with a special algorithm that makes them always solvable if you make the correct moves. And more importantly, because the tile placements on every level are randomly generated, the levels are re-playable. \n\nThe game keep tracks of the best times of and the number of wins on each board, so you can challenge yourself to go faster and beat your previous best time on that level. \n\nSo if you enjoy Mahjong (Mahjongg), solitaire, galaxy, outer space, stars, and planets, then checkout this free app. Enjoy relaxing time and challenge yourself by matching tiles and become Mahjong Solitaire master.\n\n\nSummary of Features\n- Classic/traditional Mahjong (Mahjongg) Solitaire board game rules. Easy to learn tile matching, hard to master. \n- Over 50 levels free to play, variety of challenging layout. All are free to play (no In App Purchase required).\n- Intuitive touch interface, one touch game mechanic.

If you enjoy astronomy then check out the mystifying tiles.\n- Boards are generated with random tile placements. The board generator uses a special algorithm, which produces a solvable configuration at the beginning of the game. This means the chance of getting stuck is rare (unless the player made bad moves or is unlucky and picked tiles that lead to an unsolvable configuration).\n- Try winning each board without shuffling the board, and with the shortest time possible.\n- Game keeps track of wins and best times.\n- There's no timer to rush you if you just want to relax and play.

The Cambodian transitive verb \u201cRek\u201d means \u2018carry on one\u2019s shoulder a pole at each end of which is a container, bundle or object. It was pointed out that the game was popular among military troops. Today, it is also played by Cambodian women.\n\nObjective\nThe object of the game is to \u201ccapture\u201d instead of checkmate the opponent\u2019s King. All units may be captured in two ways :\n\n   1- when they are \u201cRek\u201d by an enemy unit in the analogy that they are the containers carried away by that enemy unit. This later way of capture actually bears the name of the game.\n\n   2- when they are tightly surrounded or trapped by the enemy units and thus have no legal move.\n\nIt also has two different forces of 32 units in total . Each side starts with a force of 16 units: One King and 15 Men. All the Men have the same value and physical shape. And they all, including the Kings, move like the Boat or Rook.\n\nAnother Style of Play\u200b (Taunt enemry to Rek)\nThe Rek also has its own special style of play. It is named \u201cMin Rek Chanh\u201d (Not Rek Lose if opponent taunt). The object of the game is still the same, capturing the opponent\u2019s King. But, there is only one legal way to capture the enemy units, including the King: \u201cRek\u201d them two at a time.\n\nThe Kings may not move at all, not even a square. They are \u201cpalace kings\u201d! Other setting features and opening setup are the same as those of the regular Rek. The unique characteristic of this style of play is that a player\u2019s order of Rek to the other must be honored, otherwise the latter loses and the game is over. So, strategic and deliberate sacrifices are the mind set behind winning the game.\n\nUsually the game is over when one player orders a \u201cright\u201d series of the opponent\u2019s consecutive moves to \u2018Rek\u2019 his units which ultimately will lead to the capture or Rek of the opponent\u2019s King in return. BUT, if he orders the wrong series of the opponent\u2019s moves, he ends up losing his force without any desirable consequence. Thus the game demands a long-term and coherent strategic planning to get the right orders of move.\n\nIn this kind of play, you are in a more dangerous situation for preserving too many own units, but if you do not have enough of them to design your scheme of making a right series of the opponent\u2019s moves, it is not good either.",Nora Ky,4+,EN,49222656,Games,"Games, Board, Strategy",28/10/2014,29/11/2018,Intermediate

High resolution, letter lotto balls make up your board, bouncing, rolling, and falling into place with realistic 3D physics. Every new game refreshes the board, watch them tumble into place, then the challenge begins. Tap touching balls in sequence to make words, the longer the better. Traditional letter scores, length multipliers, gold ball doublers, and a bingo bonus determine the words value. Tap the final letter again, and pop-pop-pop, the balls burst and disappear causing the remaining balls to tumble into the empty spots and alter the layout. Choose your words carefully to maximize your results. Want to add more challenge, play a Shootout and pit your skills against friends or other Game Center players. The easiest difficulty allows two letter words, the hardest requires at least four letter words, the remaining levels a more traditional three letter minimum. You choose how hard to make it. So, why wait? Start word hunting!\n\nScoring:\nMultiplier for number of letters.\nScores for each letter:\n   1 point: E, A, I, O, N, R, T, L, S, U\n   2 points: D, G\n   3 points: B, C, M, P\n   4 points: F, H, V, W, Y\n   5 points: K\n   8 points: J, X\n   10 points: Q, Z\nGold balls double the total.\nExample: MEOW, (M 3, E 1, O 1, W 4) * (Letters 4) = 36\n\nInstructions:\nTap touching letter balls to make up words. Tap the last letter ball a second time to complete the word and claim your points. Each letter multiplies your total score, gold balls double your score, and 7 letter or more words score a 50 point bingo bonus. Multiple gold balls keep doubling your score. Traditional letter scoring is in effect, harder to use letters give higher scores. Want to try another word? Just tap on a distant ball to begin again. Blank balls act as blocks and may not be used. Choose your words carefully, once the balls burst, the boards changes, sometimes dramatically. Strategy, combined with word hunting skills are key to maximum scores.

You earn points by choosing numbers between 1 and 100.  If you choose 5, you get 5 points; if you choose 18, you get 18 points.

If you choose 12, for example, you get 12 points, but FactorMan gets 1+2+3+4+6=16 points! Once a number has been used to gain points (by either you or FactorMan), it cannot be used again, and you may choose only numbers that have at least one other factor left on the board.

It is played on a square board, made of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares on each side. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat ('check') to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.\n\nDuring the game the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board. The player with white pieces always makes the first move. Because of this, White has a small advantage, and wins more often than Black in tournament games.\n\nChess is popular and is often played in competitions called chess tournaments.

You have been ordered back to defend what is left and drive the swarmers back.\n\nYour ship, the first of its kind, is faster and more powerful that those in the destroyed fleet and so you stand a chance of victory if you can master the swarmer\'s tactics.

In each case, you face an A/I opponent playing the part of the Egyptian, Syrian, Jordanian, and Iraqi force commanders.\n\nModern Campaigns is a detailed turn-based simulation of operational warfare after World War II through until present day.  It includes detailed rules and combat resolution but has a simple interface that allows the player to focus on strategy and tactics.  A wide variety of unit types are represented including infantry, tanks, artillery, and engineers.  In addition, modern warfare is addressed in this game engine including chemical and nuclear warfare, electronic warfare (signal intelligence and jamming), and thermal sights.""",John Tiller,12+,EN,34190336,Games,"Games, Strategy, Simulation",16/01/2014,26/02/2017,High

The virus is highly aggressive and resembles a flu virus. Avoid groups of people, stay at home and ration your supplies. The government has invoked a state of emergency and mobilized the Army and National Guard. A curfew will be in force starting at dusk.\u201d\n\nBackground:\nIn the late eighties, the US Army researched a substance to optimize the fighting ability of their soldiers. Z1988-N1 (a modified flu virus) was designed to block pain receptors and help soldiers remain battle-ready despite any wounds they might incur. \nIn addition to blocking pain receptors, one ranger squad experimentally infected with Z1988-N1 remained battle-ready despite the experiment subjects suffering life-threatening injuries. However, injured tissue could not regenerate. The soldiers also became extremely aggressive and lost any and all sense of empathy. After a short while they needed to be isolated as it was impossible to guarantee the safety of those in their surroundings. The test subjects fell physically and mentally into a zombie state, where they would try to eat the uninfected. \nTen days after the start of the experiment the brass attempted to stop it. All infected people were liquidated with a shot to the head and the virus samples were sealed off.\nHowever, something went really wrong two months ago\u2026\n\nYour task:\nThe virus has spread faster than the government feared. After Z1988-N1 has taken over the east coast, the epidemic spread over the entire planet.

Author unknown ***\n\n\u2026the sun scorched our world and left behind ruins of sand, consumed by war and time. And thus we journeyed into the void, aimlessly wandering for peace and a second chance at life.\n\nThe galaxy eventually forgave our sins, sheltered us beneath the warmth of a thousand other suns, and fed us its planetary wonders. But it never once forgot our true nature.\n\nYears of hardships brought widespread discontent among the now scattered human colonies. The sky had given us hope for a new home\u2026but soon hope turned into greed, greed into hate, and hate into war. The Faction Wars, we called them. \n\nViolent in-fighting pushed us to the galaxy\u2019s limits, and to ours. They were waiting for us there. We paid no heed to them, the foolish man looking at his finger pointing at the moon. They paid no heed to us, the mighty gods uninterested in the bickering of ants.\n\nLeft to our own devices, we reunited once again under two unwavering banners: us, the Terrans and\u2026us once again, the Alterians. Only humans, divided by an invisible, impossible mountain. Terrans, all so resourceful, raised from sweat and grease yet always gazing at the line beyond the horizon. Alterians\u2026elegant, advanced, beautiful\u2026yet so eerily obsessed with the dream of otherworldly perfection.\n\nThe last two Houses of Man grew distant, as resentful brothers in a perennial fight over which family path to thread on. Never-ending expansion and gorging of resources, or rejection of human blemishes in pursuit of unachievable divinity? We chose the first and as first we stroke. We ransacked and pillaged whole worlds, and not once did we feel the burden of guilt. And now, Alterians\u2019 inhuman wrath unfolds before my eyes. As honorable and just as they sure are, never had their reaction been so vicious. \n\nI wonder as I gaze into the sky, knowing that this planet will soon be no more. No matter from which side you\u2019ll unfold the events to come, I beg you: unite mankind again, annihilate those who stand in the way, and free us from our ancestral shackles. But most of all, I beg you forgiveness for the man I once was.\n\nMay the horizon never look so broken again.\n\n*** End of transmission ***",Aykiro s.r.o.,9+,EN,628111360,Games,"Games, Action, Strategy, Entertainment",25/03/2017,27/10/2017,High
