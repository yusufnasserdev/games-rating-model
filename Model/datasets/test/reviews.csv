I studied the lumber science but I guess I can only remove trees using magic???? Before getting the forester‚Äôs hut I never had enough lumber and I was constantly using up all my magic to collect any. My city is almost completely covered with trees but using the altar only gives me so little magic in such a long period of time so I have no way of efficiently removing them all.', 'Thank you for the feedback! The maximum amount of mana has been recounted for all functions - less mana is required to create books and spells. And also it is replenished automatically.', 'Congratulations, you‚Äôve just made the game too detailed to get any enjoyment from playing. Mills, Farms, Gardens no longer produce bread (food), which was used as a necessary resource for advancement. Now they produce one ingredient to make bread and you have to collect them all in sufficient quantities in order to produce bread in a bakery, which is another step added as of this update to the list to get bread as a resource. Gaining building materials have also become a more complex system, and it was already fairly complex the further one got into the game. Where before a simple exchange of one resource for another was necessary, now multiple resources are needed to exchange for a single other resource. Random other resources (paint and wine)  have been created to make it even more difficult to collect things and advance in the game. To make things even more frustrating, all my resources stockpiled have been erased so that the game can now start off on a clean slate with the more detailed requirements. I‚Äôve put much effort into getting those resources and now it‚Äôs back to the starting gate. Only this time, the resources have been broken down into pieces, so one can only imagine how long that will take to advance in the game. I‚Äôm officially done with this game. Good luck to everyone who choose to continue to soldier on in this game.', 'Thank you for the feedback. We look forward to your return!', 'Downloaded and tried your game app today. I am not an idiot and can follow instructions. Unfortunately there are games that seem to over explain the simple steps and ultimate goal of a game app but this one is the opposite with no guidance about what the overall goal is and just how to lay the game? It stated to catch the falling blue dots and stars, buy and build buildings, collect grass, and a few other things. Sorry it simply wasn‚Äôt fun or entertaining. I think it has potential but maybe instead of all the characters popping up and making comments just for the sake of making comments that don‚Äôt have anything to do with the game at the time, perhaps a more detailed play guide and overall goal would be beneficial. If that happens I would try it again but can‚Äôt like this, so sorry no disrespect intended. Good luck', 'Thank you for the feedback! The tutorial will last throughout the game. As soon as you increase the level, there will be new tasks with training from the Gods.', ""This game is outrageously slow, even among city builders... looking at you simpsons. Despite a great look and presentation, after 2 days of playing ive accomplished nothing and barely get to do anything. The better city builders slow down too, but they at least give you a decent push into having a cool little village or something to care about before they starve you out of 'gems' or slow down build times.This one isn't the worst but just not that fun, and you run yourself out of gems before you doing anything worthwhile, that, and the price of gems, and the fact that some items just outright cost money makes this one easy to pass.A game for whales, basically."", 'I played this game awhile back and loved it. I had to quit for a while and when I came back to play again I saw there hadn‚Äôt been any updates for months ‚òπÔ∏è. So I waited to see if the game was still supported and I‚Äôm so glad I decided to check again because I noticed it had been updated a couple times üòÅ. So I downloaded and started back up right when I left off and once again this is becoming my favorite game again. Please keep updating. I love mythology and this game is perfect. ü•∞', 'Thank you for feedback!', 'I‚Äôm not the only one having problems.  We go to put the road down that it asks for, gotta have ten, costs twelve wood per section.  You can put it down all day long, hit the check mark to finish the mission, and the road disappears.  Otherwise, its a really cute and fun game.  And, some of us don‚Äôt use facebook, so friending is just out of the question, so its a solo game.  If we had a game ID to give to a persons to invite them, now that would be much better.  I give it a three star rating, fix the bug and maybe consider the ID so we don‚Äôt have to use facebook. Thanks! :)', 'They lost 2stars because you can only get friends through Facebook. It can be fun and a little slow for me in the beginning but I balance that with another game I play. I don‚Äôt know how much depends on having neighbors but I know there is a collection that is tied to visiting neighbors and right now I only have 1 (2 total, game npc gives you one so if you don‚Äôt have Facebook or don‚Äôt want to add more people then you are guaranteed at least 1).  If we can ever get friends/neighbors without friending them on Facebook then I will DEFINITELY consider giving more stars.', 'Thank you for the feedback. The collection can be collected by visiting only Aphrodite.', 'I really did enjoy playing the game but on the last update witch took to long it messed up everything!!! I can no longer see what my tasks are I can no long cash in the items that I found/collected. And in the game when you try to send the issue out the option is never available it always says there is a problem. The game worked so much better before the last ""bug fix"" was done. I really did enjoy playing it, but now I think I\'m going to delete it because I am unable to go any further in the game itself and a game where I have nothing left I can do is not a game I wanna play any longer... Wish you would fix the issue until then this game is gone.', ""In the two times I have had to contact support due to game issues, the have neglected to make any type of contact with me. I have been without the game since the June update and have sent numerous messages with not even an automated email from them. I even sent an email to realore letting them know the support page was not working and had been down for a few weeks, again with no response. I did enjoy this game while I could play, but now I'm fed up with it. It's something to do with my account once again as I have uninstalled & reinstalled the game. Ultimately, just very poor service. Good Bye Divine Academy! Was fun while it lasted."", 'Update: no response from developers for weeks. Deleted game. New developer is just as bad as the old. I started playing this game years ago before the developer went kaput. I‚Äôm so glad it‚Äôs back, but! I cannot get through the Island of Power. Every time I close the game, the whole thing resets to zero. I put in a ticket, no response. I am NOT happy. I can‚Äôt move forward in the game until I finish this, but it won‚Äôt let me. I‚Äôve used thousands in resources trying to get through it, but every reset, the cost for the tasks gets bigger. I‚Äôm just about done. Bad show.']"

I have tried 2 other shogi apps (including morita) and this one is the best by far. If your a fan of chess give shogi a try, you won't be disappointed!"", 'If you have never heard of shogi and you like western chess you should give this a try. Shogi is extremely popular in Japan. It adds an extra level of complexity and fun by allowing you to use pieces that you capture. On your turn, instead of moving a piece you can place a captured opponents piece almost anywhere ( with some restrictions) on the board. If you think about this, it opens up a lot of strategic and tactical options. You wont be disappointed.', 'If you fixed it to where it shows the title number/letter (ex. 8c) that would be great. Also smoothing out graphic details along with the double-tap zoom which is unecessary and quite annoying. Also something to tell you you are in check or checkmate would also be great. Asides from all that though this is a great game and can only hope future updates further improve the gameplay.', 'Well polished game with good indicators of where you can move and has good tutorials. It seems though as if the computer levels are reversed as I can last much longer versus level 7 than against level 1. Might be a bug or something', ""I've been waiting for this for a while!  It's really great; well done AI!  One request would be to make the Japanese style pieces a bit easier to distinguish.  Well done!"", 'Overall, a well thought out game.  The controls are simple and get the job done.  The only thing this seems to be lacking is a more refined graphical presentation.  Shine up the graphics and I think this will be a five-star game.

It is the bishop (""angle-mover"" piece).', 'The resign button needs a confirmation or should be in the pop-up menu to prevent accidental resignations.

1117841866,"[""The review by Slawguhy is true (game is not ptw). He said it's a slow crawl and  meant to be an adventure you play for months/years. This is absolutely true. I've been playing for about 4.5 years now. And while i have spent money here and there, it's not necessary. One thing I've learned over the years is that spending is a gamble similar to winning the lottery (you have a 1.3% chance of pulling legendary heroes in almost every event and theme). But there is a building you get much later in the game that can produce these heroes for free (albeit, also a low chance of getting what you want or need). The benefit of this is that it offers A LOT of variety in PvP and PvE play. If everyone got so the good heroes all the time, everyone would have the same teams. One AMAZING thing about this game that i can't say about many other games is that the ads are completely optional. There are  two areas that give ads. One gives random loot and the other gives random low level heroes and troops in exchange for watching. So they're not just optional, they're not necessary for gameplay. You can literally play this game for years without having to pay a dime or watch a single ad! I've never played a mobile game as long as i have played this one. The graphics are great, bugs are infrequent (almost never encounter), it's a lot of fun! Definitely give it a try and see for yourself."", 'The reviews on here that state you have to ‚Äúpay to win‚Äù and ‚Äúnever guaranteed you do win when you spend x amount‚Äù are Bogus claims. Playing this game is a marathon, not a dAsh to the finish. It‚Äôs team building; material farming adventure that takes months to get every character and item your so desperately wanting. The Months it takes to lever characters, upgrade buildings, play through the story and quests takes time and patience. You can spend money to get the things your so desperately wanting now with odd/chances against you OR you can just play the game and wait for the quest and tournaments to give you the items your wanting(takes time) What your goals in the gameplay can also differ. So any reviews telling you about bad character/teams or not getting them. Those people know they spend money with odd slim and change with every season. and spending money is no guarantee to any item due to the lottery/change type of buying. They tell you the % of chance to get certain items/If your looking for a game you can dig into, put in the time needed to make it the team and build it have patience because they give you gem to spend, they give you many items to build you characters. Give this game the your time it deserves before giving it a review. **Happy Adventures Slawguhy', 'This game has progressively gotten worse and worse. I one point I would had said you can play the game and be pretty successful without paying. Anymore , however, they have dialed way back on mats so if you‚Äôre lucky enough to get five star hero‚Äôs you won‚Äôt get the mats to lvl them. I have multiple five stars that I‚Äôve had for YEARS and can‚Äôt get enough mats to lvl them all the way up. Of coarse you can pay $30+ bucks to be able to get the mats to do 1 hero if you have the other mats to do so, spoiler, you won‚Äôt unless you neglect every other hero until you pay for your mats. Now I couldn‚Äôt always say this , they wouldn‚Äôt keep up exactly , but you could get through a few five star hero‚Äôs. If you stayed active on the game. I would reward them by buying gems to get hero‚Äôs at 30 bucks a pop, for a ten pull, and didn‚Äôt flinch, now unless you buy everything you will not be successful at this game.  The tile drops have gotten to be crap too. You have a team that is solid‚Ä¶. Well they just won‚Äôt give you the tiles to win, so all you end up doing is charging up the other teams hero‚Äôs and get frustrated as you see them pick one hero off after another. One week your entire alliance does well (in wars) with descent boards, the next nothing but poo. They claim it‚Äôs random drops I STRONGLY disagree. This game has done nothing but become a money pit and a frustration. Always figured games were to be fun and relaxing this one breaks that mold 10 fold.', 'Thank you for the review.

Use the button in the top right corner to contact us (Android: speech bubble icon, iOS: ""Contact Us"").', 'I‚Äôve played for several years and it‚Äôs okay, the numbers creep is rough, the difference between a season one and a season five hero fully leveled is vast. So expect that even if you a full team of season one legendary heroes you will lose to a team of newer heroes. It‚Äôs a business, they‚Äôre trying to make money, I get that. If you can get everything to be a top player without spending money there‚Äôd be no incentive to. That being said, you can spend hundreds and never pull a legendary and I don‚Äôt like that you can go through and get coins from an event where the only way to get them is to purchase it and you‚Äôll still only pull season one rares, that‚Äôs bad business. For example if you get enough of the three kingdoms coins to do a ten summon then you pull four of the same season one rares(I‚Äôm looking at you Dawa) and you‚Äôve spent thirty dollars for trash you‚Äôre going to feed to a character you already have. This wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if you were dealing with NFT but the characters aren‚Äôt tradeable. Their answer to this was the soul exchange where the ‚Äúbest‚Äù hero costs twenty legendary heroes for you all of the legendary heroes are the same value but theirs have levels, ten, fifteen and twenty. It‚Äôs a bit unreasonable and though I hesitate to say it because I hate the term, unfair. It doesn‚Äôt have to be fair though, we choose to play. Anyway, fun game but know you‚Äôre not ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù in getting better, you‚Äôre buying and hoping to and hope isn‚Äôt a good strategy.', 'Thank you for the review.

It‚Äôs a free to play phone game and they have to have some way to make money. You are not obligated to pay anything at any time. I know people that have not spent a dime on this game but I‚Äôve been playing for way longer than I have. There are other claims that this is a pay to win the game and that is largely false. You could spend $10,000 on pools in this game and not get a single thing that you really want well someone could do one free pool and get the thing you‚Äôve been looking for. That‚Äôs just the luck of the draw. That‚Äôs the great equalizer of the game. I love this game and I love the alliance system and I play every single day. My biggest gripe about the game is that there are definitely a lot of social systems that could use improvements. The thing about that however is that the forms are very active and the mods on the forms are very attentive to your suggestions. I was actually responsible for creating an entire troop type in this game just based on the suggestion that I made on the forums and the moderators told me that my suggestion was being implemented It was really cool to feel like I was a part of the game', 'I would give this game a higher rating. There‚Äôs so many good things about the game play and different ways to play. I‚Äôve played it everyday since November 2018.  I‚Äôm embarrassed to say how much I have spent on gems, but I added it up $5,200. I went from rarely spending on a game to overspending small buys at a time.  Most purchases were under $30.  I don‚Äôt mind spending money to get what I need. But I don‚Äôt like to gamble.  In other games you spend money on gems and buy the hammer you want.  Here you buy gems with a 1-3% chance to get that hammer. In this case a particular hero. At the height of my spending I spent over $600 trying to get a particular hero and didn‚Äôt even get it.  I‚Äôm so far invested in the game, it‚Äôs hard to walk away.  If I had it to do over I would not download this game.  My opinion further degraded over recent decisions the developers made.  We don‚Äôt have any rights after spending money time and resources on our teams. They can just change the hero at will.  There‚Äôs many simple things they could do to make the game less like gambling. If the priced a hero at $200 and you knew you could get it for the money or you could pull for it at the summon gate that would be great.  If they stopped messing with heroes after they‚Äôre released. Again simple fix that costs them nothing.  I‚Äôve tried to stop spending, but it‚Äôs harder than going vegan.  I have to stop playing.  $5,200 worth small buys is out of control.  Don‚Äôt start playing.', ""Thank you for your review. Legendary Heroes are very rare, and we can't guarantee that you will receive one, even if you Summon a great number of Heroes. All players have equal chances for Summoning, so while we acknowledge that getting a Legendary Hero is definitely not easy, we also consider the system to be fair. Best of luck in battles!"", 'I don‚Äôt know. We are a group of 7 people. I must spend some money sometime. However, my friends doesn‚Äôt. They are poor, so They save a lot of gems for fortune. Until now they are at level 28, they are still bad luck and didn‚Äôt get any 5 heros. Even if you have 5 stars hero. You still need to wait a long time to find the items to update your heros. My clan members just told me... He just got the last ring that he needs since almost 2 years... We lost titan, war by weird matching. I am scared. Today My friends tell me they will quit the game. They told me :‚Äù It is so expensive, nonsense, unreasonable waiting for a really good game.‚Äù Im sad. I think if they quit, I will quit too. I dont know how to play game alone without my friends. This game used to give a really great memories. Update: I think I did my review for over 5 months until you guys responded. :-/ . The game is getting better than before a lot. After a year playing the game, My group is now only have 2 left. They all give up on the game because of bad luck with summons and collecting items to max training for 5 stars heroes ( 7 members before). They got frustrated and mad then left. I was sad cause all my best friends are left. However the game already got better by adding some good quests before they left. ( still so long but better than nothing). I want to play a game for long term even without my friends. My new friends from my alliance are amazing.', 'Thank you for your review. Empires & Puzzles is completely free to play.

Partly because I‚Äôve made some great friends in my alliance I‚Äôve been a daily player. The game itself is a clever combination of elements built around a core match 3 setup. The defining gameplay feature centers on the placement of your matches on the board dictate what enemy you hit, it opens up a depth of strategy and fun not found in other rpg/match 3 mashups. As others have noted it is a looong term game. As far as requiring money to advance, It certainly helps, but there are many high level players in our alliance that have spent $0-$20 over a year span. Most frustrating element is drop rates on items needed to ascend your 5* heroes. Honestly if you play a lot you will be able to pick up the items you need to ascend 4* heroes regularly, but those dang top end materials are few and far between. It took me 10 months to get enough materials to max my first 5* hero. This game is a grind, the greed of developers can be a bit offensive, but the irony of spending money on gems to get better heroes is the better heroes are worthless until you play the game enough to get the items needed to make them stronger so it is really counterproductive to your game to do so. Better off being patient, finding a good alliance and letting your team grow organically.', 'Thank you for your review. High-level ascension materials are rare by design, and especially the epic ascension items are indeed very difficult to get. We are always monitoring the economy, and making adjustments to the rarities in the future is not out of the question. I really hope the odds will be in your favor in the future!', 'I‚Äôve played this game for over 3 years, during which time I‚Äôve invested a modest amount of money and a significant amount of time in my little digital kingdom and beloved heroes. This review is from a place of significant experience and fondness, but also objective honesty. The world of mobile games is dominated by match 3 puzzles for a reason. They are quick and intuitive, they are shiny and addictive. This game is no different but incorporates an expansive campaign and hero mechanics system that puts it into the realm of some of the best mobile RPGs. The developers regularly feed the app new content, and the global player base is generally very healthy (my own alliance is made up of polite supportive strangers). These elements all make for a finely tuned game that is easy to pick up and stays fun and competitive at even the highest levels of play. As with any mobile game, there are issues in Empires: annoying pop up ads, mind-numbing resource farming, an abysmally slow building upgrade system, overtly sexist female characters/avatars, and the pay to win factor here is significant, but Empires can be fun as a 100% free game as well. I have friends with a few less heroes on their rosters, but healthier bank accounts. Overall the game is great, assuming your patience and resilience is as well.', ""Thank you for taking the time to review Empires & Puzzles. We're sorry to hear you didn't enjoy it.

However, there are minor things that can be modified to make my rating jump to 5 stars. I just feel like you should be able to upgrade multiple buildings at once. Waiting 2 days for one building to finish is ridiculous. Either upgrading multiple buildings at once or changing the time frame would be suitable. Then, there‚Äôs the troops that can‚Äôt be upgraded. What‚Äôs the point in having all the same troops if I can‚Äôt add them to one another. I have 1 star troops just sitting there for no reason. I‚Äôm given literally the same troops every random draw. The algorithm for that should be fixed to where it‚Äôs not so rare to get 4 or 5 star troops/ heros. And if there is a button to level up your troops then that should be more apparent. Instead of searching high and low to figure out if it‚Äôs possible to do so. Also, how are you supposed to use the emblems without any since of direction? I‚Äôm over here stuck with 41 of the same emblem because I don‚Äôt know when I can use it nor how I can.

631262453,"['Most everything about the game is well balanced.  The art is beautiful.  While the game and its mechanics are very well thought out, I reserve one star because since it\'s inception, the user interface has always been lackluster.  The movement of the cards feel too linear and sluggish when compared to something like hearthstone, which gives them a kind of light mass.  The menus can be a lot more intuitive.  The cards themselves look one dimensional objects.  Even the card edges seem jagged at times.  Also, everything seems very dark.  I understand that it\'s a part of the theme, but things can definitely be brightened up a bit.  Lastly, the music, visual, and sound effects are equally camp.  Overall, while the development team have done an amazing job of implementing this digital CCG and its gaming components, they\'ve left the actual experience of playing it wanting.  It simply doesn\'t ""feel nice,"" and this makes it seem like a low budget movie.', 'This is easily the fairest, and funnest mobile TCG I‚Äôve played. I‚Äôve played MTG off and on for about 23 years, and at one time I came to prefer Shadow Era over MTGo. The cards are well thought out to avoid overpowering strategies, while remaining devastating in their combination. Getting a competitive deck together is blissfully easy for a free player, yet building a truly competitive deck takes skill. Wulven however, could really use a better plan, and more support. There have been very few cards added to a relatively small card pool since I started about 4-5 years ago. The post-release changes to digital cards makes buying the physical cards seem like a shaky idea. There didn‚Äôt seem to be much thought about tournaments when designing the UI so (the last I knew) they were setting them up using private battle function, since there were only 3 ways to play, Campaign(AI), Battle (Random opponent), or private battle (password to enter). This seemed like a very sloppy way to organize a tournament, and it would be much nicer to see it integrated into the UI, so players can enter and play tournaments through the menu. All that aside I still give it five stars, because it is a game that focuses on fairness and fun over being an overly flashy cash-grab, and that‚Äôs rare but it shows integrity. I‚Äôve made several crystal purchases just to support Wulven for a job well done.', 'A good long while back i reviewed this game and had a few good things and a few bad to say about it. But now with the story mode update things are different. I really really like the story, and i love going through all over again with different hero cards and leveling them all individually as a ahow of my own mastery of that character and its abilities and cards. Something i really dont enjoy is how on any higher dificulty the bots begin to cheat. They automatically start with a free card drawn, and by the time you have enough allies to wipe the board they have enough resources to draw several out at once and just finish off your remaining health. If i were to improve that, or offer suggestion to do so, instead of letting them spawn minions immediately, upgrade their deck and make the AI smarter. Dont cheat for the bot but instead make them more challenging with really tough cards and smart enough to not just focus on your hero alone but react to what you draw. Unfortunately i want to give it more stars than i did the first time but i cant overlook that major issue, as well as the strange bugs that occur durring story mode play. Elementalis has given me several problems in battle where it simply stops playing after a certain turn count, or it draws a certain card and freaks out. If these things are ever changed my review will also change drastically to match the updates. But for now it will remain at 3 stars, definately worth playing.', ""This game set a huuuuge standard for me when it was released. There was nothing like it, and as an experienced paper TCG player (Magic: The Gathering Yu-Gi-Oh, World of Warcraft TCG, Pok√©mon, etc) I was a little iffy about getting into a mobile version of a card game, but this was fair, didn't take long to get a collection going and more importantly? It is super fun. Incredibly fun. It mashed two of my personal favourite TCG's together in a beautiful fashion; Magic, and the WoW TCG. The resource system is beautiful, no strategy is too broken in competitive play, and the Dev has released consistent enough manner to be able to keep up with current stuff, without the older sets being forgotten. It's still going strong, and I still to this day enjoy it. It's been years. I've played in some tournaments (not super successfully :P) and just simply have had fun. It's a good TCG. If you're remotely into them, try them. I love Hearthstone and other mobile TCG's as well. But Shadow Era will always have my heart on the phone/PC screen."", 'I really like Shadow Era. I like how it has evolved. I like how cards are attainable. It\'s a very good game. A couple of nit picky issues I have with it are that the game is kind of slow. Some times certain animations or other ""moments"" in the game could be sped up or eliminated all together. The game can feel slow paced because of this at times. Another nitpicky issue is that I don\'t love the addition of location cards. That whole mechanic of the game seems stupid to me (not to be disparaging). That\'s just my personal preference though. Others may like it. Overall, I really like this game a lot. It\'s not quite as polished as hearthstone, but the fun factor is there for sure.', ""This was my first foray into trading card games. After looking into the options, Hearthstone and Magic were the logical choice given their popularity. But I felt those would be too overwhelming and I would be destroyed. So I tried Shadow Era. So far, it's been reasonably easy to pick up the basics and fun to play. I'd definitely recommend playing this game. Plus, the price is great--FREE. A few things I would criticize are the somewhat slow animations, not so intuitive GUI and general lack of guidance. The basics are easy enough though, strategy will take longer. I started in the campaign mode versus AI and initially just selected the first hero (Boris). I went through about 7 matches at easy and normal level winning them all. Then I went to the hard level and found it virtually unbeatable. I suspect to beat it I have to accumulate better cards and build more power into my deck. This may be where the fun is for many but for a noob, it can be a source of frustration not realizing you're in an unwinnable position and struggling to just find the right strategy. When the right strategy is to get different cards for your deck. Regardless, the game is a lot of fun. I like the graphics. GUI could be improved to remove some clocks and speed up games by a couple minutes (I'm mostly playing on iPhone). Definitely give this game a try."", 'Great to play something not begging for money that has regular updates and bring new features. There is a solo game play that can be challenging and will make you use your brain to build a deck to beat it (three star solo missions). PVP is very balanced with lots of players. Also a meltdown version that lets you play cross class cards you don‚Äôt own which is a way to discover new stuff. All cards are available in the store so while it will take you a bit of time to build up you might find yourself playing in years and I believe there is a dual pvp version in development. Genuinely a great game. Only negative is that if you want more from the community and guilds you have to use Messenger app to log into the approved chat rooms as the game a single world chat room. GLHF', 'I played Magic the Gathering for years. Then I sold all my cards. I picked this gem up a few years ago and have not put it down. The developers do periodic expansions with a strong effort to balance the game. All this for free. If you want you can pay for bling, but you can get and use all of the cards through play. The clincher for me is meltdown. It is a limited card pool make a deck on the fly format. You open 4 virtual packs and make a deck from what you got.  No game is ever the same. Super replay value with enough players that you never have to wait long.  There are bugs, but also an active community of players weeding them out. Great game. One year from my last review.  Still playing this game. It is worth the download.', 'An awesome free-to-play digital ccg which I highly recommend if you\'re looking for something the likes of MTG. Even though you can gradually earn credits to get all the cards you want, I dropped $20 on this 6 years ago as I saw potential and wanted to support the game. And, although I don\'t think I\'ve spent but half that since then, I\'ve played it regularly without regrets. The only thing lacking in comparison to some CCGs is more interactive cards (think ""instants"" or ""activated abilities"" in response to opponents spells). That said, the game runs a lot more smoothly than it would with these as you don\'t have to wait for opponent responses to your actions... You just have to wait for them to complete their turn.', 'I played this game a few years ago, before it had a definitive campaign. The artwork and designs are nice as ever, and the gameplay is still enjoyably challenging. I‚Äôve played into a couple campaigns and so far haven‚Äôt hit a paywall.I‚Äôm not usually one for trading card games, but this one has enough content to be enjoyable - even accommodating different playing styles instead of just draw-to-fight. One thing I would note is that the dialogue between characters seems to be mispaced. They start in the middle of the conversation and repeat a couple times.']"

1290010412,"['I don‚Äôt really have any complaints about the game! I‚Äôve loved it since it‚Äôs release. Yes, it‚Äôs expensive to purchase shinobites and other items, but if you play daily or just often, and actually complete missions, participate in events, play the story modes and what not, they all rack up REALLY quickly! (I mean, most special missions allow you to earn 30-50 shinobites each on their own....) I‚Äôve gotten all my favorites up to a B or C rank with a little effort and spending no real money. I have so many cards I‚Äôve had to expand my card slots over 20 times lol There‚Äôs so many missions, special events, story mode, and other little fun side bits to do in the game you almost never get bored (playing some levels over and over CAN get repetitive after a while)If I had to give one piece of criticism, it would be that there need to be more special missions added more frequently (the ones where you earn tokens to level up characters) as I‚Äôve beaten all the ones on the game ages ago, and new ones seem to only be added once in a blue moon. It would be nice to have new ones more often and bring back old ones more frequently so we can earn tokens for the ones we either missed, new players didn‚Äôt get to play, or to help build our characters up more. But other than that, I‚Äôm happy and love this game.', 'Don‚Äôt get me wrong this game is amazing but I just don‚Äôt like how the cards make the character better I wanted the character to be the good part, cards have to be matched up to a character to have a jutsu like WHAT?! And not only that you need shinobite to open these packs and it‚Äôs not guaranteed that you get the card for the right person and shinobite is expensive and takes a while to rack up also I don‚Äôt want to be playing as a certain character I love with no jutsu because I don‚Äôt have the card vs playing somebody who you don‚Äôt like just because they have a Jutsu and deal more damage I think the game should add options where you can buy jutsu‚Äôs from a certain character but it won‚Äôt always be good because when you buy packs it can go to any character I don‚Äôt care if the card packs cost an extra 50 for a certain person or 100 or even if the jutsu is bad I just don‚Äôt want to be using my fists to fight (when I say cards I mean ninja cards) in conclusion just make it where you can buy a jutsu of a certain character but it‚Äôs still random and make it cost more by 50. Giving it five stars because this game still has potential to fix this and I don‚Äôt want ratings to go down FUN GAME', 'It‚Äôs definitely a pay to win game, also it‚Äôs a bit annoying having to see the same characters pop up over and over during a new month instead of giving us a costume for the characters, but I suppose it‚Äôs the best Naruto gaming app. They added a new level to the characters but only certain characters have this new level available instead of giving it to every character and Naruto‚Äôs newest form is too over powered in my opinion. But the game could be fun at times, I‚Äôm hoping for a good and new character that isn‚Äôt Naruto, Sasuke, or Sakura for the hundredth time but we‚Äôll see. On a side note, it would be cool if they could have a button for each character on your team so that they could stay put behind you or go forward as well as use their attacks when called upon because even for support characters they don‚Äôt use their abilities unless fighting and that‚Äôs if the game allows them to. But again I think the game is the best Naruto game so far.Naruto Six Paths Sage Mode Light is way too over powered, he could block any status changes, drains cp when attacking, sets down damage fields of different sorts, and besides having extremely high def/attack he has immortality. So if you wanna beat everyone, he‚Äôs the first to get cause just about every player has him leveled up, I would say almost no on else has a chance against him unless you are extremely skilled or get lucky. They definitely need to nerf him, game isn‚Äôt that fun w him being too OP.', 'Alright, I can now say it after everything you people have done, This game is finally F2P! I enjoy the fact that you have made step summons that give GREAT rewards, I can even complete the whole linkboard without spending a penny. I even with these impressive improvements, I have found a small bug in Naruto FS‚Äôs 5* jutsu. This is supposed to make you invisible for like 2 seconds, and it does show the invisibility sparkles, but when I use it when in AM and get hit with an EX ult, I still can get killed, and I mean the second I become invincible. This may just be a bug on my part, but I would appreciate if you would check this out. Lastly, again, in AM quite a lot of times, I will be sent to the title screen, or kicked from a mission, it is frustrating for me. I hope this is just a bug for me, because it has been happening a lot lately. Other than that, this game is AMAZING ü§©! I hope you continue what you do and continue to develop. Thanks for your time!*UPDATE*This game is amazing as ever. The 5th anniversary is amazing! I appreciate all the things you have done for this game.

It‚Äôs very well made and the combat is very fun. When I first downloaded this game I was playing it non stop. Speed up about 14 days later and I start encountering a huge problem. The game consistently crashes while I‚Äôm trying to play it. This was a huge issue because obviously this made it impossible to play but also whenever I went into a mission my stamina would also be drained so it just completely wasted my time. I ended up uninstalling the game because it got to the point where the game was unplayable and I reinstalled it. When I did I was horrified to find that all my data and progress had been lost. I contacted customer service and long story short they were unable to get back my data. I was really bummed out and angry because I had spent some money on this game and genuinely enjoyed it. So I would say that there needs to be a way to ensure that people who lose there data can get it back. I also wish there was a number I could have called because I was basically being sent an automated message through email and had to answer questions that would determine if I would get my account back. You guys fix the bug that kicks players out the game and find a way to ensure that players can get back lost data I‚Äôll I will gladly give this game 5 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è.', 'I love this game , and as a fellow anime fan and naruto fan I am addicted to this game .üòÅ But there are a few things that I think should be fixed.üòØ First off , summon. What I think should be fixed is the cost. I think the cost for  a 10x summon should be 400 shinobite. Next ,is also about summon . What I think is that summons should also be cut in half , and the cost will also be cut in half for people who don‚Äôt have enough shinobite to do a 10x summon. Instead they could do a 5x summon for only 200 shinobite or 250 shinobite if the cost for summon is not changed. Last, is about shop. This last one is about daily shop and the shinobi gems to awaken them. For the daily shop , it needs to be more mixed up. Like have ninja tools in it or other stuff, because it‚Äôs always ninja card enhancement stuff and nothing elseüò¢. And for the stuff for awakening, needs to go up. Litterly , you have to pay 40 shinobite for 10 awakening gems . Not coolüò°! Instead of just 10 you need to make it 20 or 25 just not 10. Overall though, this is a really awesome game and for anyone who loves naruto this is a game for .            From NovaVartex ( ninja voltage name) . Also I am the guild leader of Dat Guild . ü§óBYE !üòÅ', 'The mechanics are pretty good and it‚Äôs overall a fun game to play. However, there‚Äôs a big flaw right now when it comes to the summoning. Most summonings cost 500 gems and most of them require several steps in order to get any good cards. In story missions and most special missions you can normally get around 5 to 10 gems the first time you complete it. There are a few, like the evolution missions that actually do give ~30 gems for completion, but once you get that, it‚Äôs gone. In the achievements, you‚Äôre lucky if a reward exceeds 5, and daily rewards are ridiculously low. So, a player might try to buy a few gems in order to get cards for their favorite character, but  the cost makes it not worth it. It costs $5 for 50 gems, which can get you one (1) entire card. At $45, you can get around 800 gems, but that isn‚Äôt even enough to clear 2 rounds of normal 500 gem spawns. I‚Äôd suggest that you increase the amount regular missions give out from 5 (low power) or 10 (medium power) to maybe 15 or 20, decrease the dollar cost to buy them, and perhaps reset the rewards in certain missions (evolution and the hero ones) every few days so high level players aren‚Äôt stuck not being able to get more gems. Alternatively, you could reduce the cost of spawns massively and get rid of multi-step ones.', ""When I first got this game I was immediately addicted so now I've been playing for about a year and I'm B rank and it was definitely worth the grind. Some issues with the game is the ninja tools, it is super hard to get a good ninja tool especially for beginners because either you have to buy them or you have to grind for hours on a round up mission and when they give them to you for free they are usually garbage and useless. Another thing I‚Äôd like to point out is the STAT cards because to get a strong shinobi you need either multiple ultimates or stat cards and most of the time the top tier stat cards are only obtainable buy buying shinobites so the creators are taking advantage or forcing people into buying shinobites just to get stronger. The last thing I want to mention is that the drop rates for ultimates are way too low. The drop rates are always around 3 percent so you have a very low chance of getting an ultimate on a x10 summon so I think the drop rates should be around 10 or 12. Overall this game still deserves a 5 because of it's constant updates and is super addicting. Also events like SAM are very fun."", 'First I would like to start off by saying this is a great game for the Naruto fandom; although there is no longer a story to it, getting a chance to unlock characters from the ninja world and use their jutsu is very interesting. The only frustrating thing about this game is the constant disconnecting I have been facing since the most recent update, it doesn‚Äôt matter where I am or if I‚Äôm using wifi or 5G data the game will randomly pop up this message saying there was an unknown error then boot me back to the title screen of the game and it is very frustrating when you are in the middle of an attack mission, because they will literally penalize you and make your score drop because the game forcibly kicked you out, I have played many mobile games that have randomly disconnected you in the past but this one is by far the most annoying because the other games do not penalize you for them kicking you out of a match they will however either let u return where you left off before you were booted or leave your score as it was before you entered the match. I am seriously asking for the disconnecting to be fixed and for the penalties for being kicked out of a game to be changed as a paying player.', 'After the 2nd year anniversary (which was amazing btw) NxB has started to fall off with adding UNNECESSARY OP UNITS LIKE KANKURO  this doesn‚Äôt help when especially when they‚Äôre SAM special shinobis and have a stupid amount of multipliers compared to another SAM special shinobi to put this into perspective what it would take a OP unit like Kankuro to get 10mil on a lvl 50 Boss(1Game) it would take any other special shinobi (5games) and this isn‚Äôt the first time Bandai has done this going back to the 2nd anniversary SAM they did this with Hashirama Senju Rekit but that was a little more manageable but now it‚Äôs getting out of hand. Do better Bandai is all I can say and if you guys don‚Äôt want to listen to the feedback of the community I don‚Äôt see this game lasting to the 3yr anni if Bandai keeps making irrelevant people OP for what? It‚Äôs easy so more people can start dumping money into this money hungry company but when people start quitting then you‚Äôll wanna listen to the community it‚Äôs not to late bruh, ALSO THIS GAME IS VERY PAY TO WIN if your not gonna fork over some money while playing this game don‚Äôt expect to have many things that you want Im for one a f2p player and can only summon on a shinobi banner every other month(2ish-3ish months) and the worst part is going 3k deep in the ing currency and not getting the units kit tempting you to but more of the ing currency to keep summoning SUPER P2W Do better is all I can say Bandai.']"

The tutorials aren't very informative. I'm level two and I still don't know how everything works! Here's some tips to help you understand the game. Tip one ‚òùüèΩ Use auto battle. The fighting in this game is all about strategic thinking ü§î, but some people might pick the wrong move and regret it. The boss has many different powers that it uses at different times, but calculating that is suuuuuuper hard. If you're NOT like me and want to take a shortcut than this is the way. #MandolorianBabyYoda. If you ARE like me and want strategy here's 2 tips on that. Tip two do not just press buttons! When you are fighting the enemy don't just press buttons! Why? Well you need to think strategically about your moves. For example if you use a move that has a 50% chance of stunning the enemy and if it does stun the enemy you get another turn. Then if you use the move that doubles the attack power if they are stunned during the extra turn, it is a smart move. Tip 3 you must look at the bosses skills to predict his moves. If you predict his moves you can easily beat him. Tip 4 Hold down the button for the description on the move.

The events are wonderful and seem to take into account newer players into account when they release them, so they aren‚Äôt left out of great rewards. It contains a wide variety of monsters to use and deep strategy to building the right team for each of the modes. Definitely something I would recommend at-least trying for a while before you make a decision on the game for it can take a second to really get started a get a sense of what you are doing. But afterwards you really start to take on the challenge of building a strong team and improving you monsters. There are many guilds and helpful players in the community though which is a very fascinating, because it can be very hard to Find a healthy community in games. There are a couple of negatives I find with the game and developers though, as the micro transactions are insanely expensive and you‚Äôll get them flashed on your screen quite a bit while you navigate the menus, you can easily just click them away though. And rising in pvp ranks can be quite a hassle as there are many lvl 50 players who just sit in the lower ranks with max lvl monsters as their defense, which makes it very frustrating for newer and mid level players to climb.

But that isn‚Äôt the case, all you need to do is farm. There‚Äôs always events to do and that‚Äôs a really big plus for me, I barely pay for mobile games but I felt the need to support this company. Only pack that I see really worth the money is the growth pack, everything else is more meh. The only things I‚Äôd have adjusted is the matchmaking system in arena, to get rid of ghost accounts, and to buff the rates for 5* and 6* runes in gb8/9, I‚Äôm still really only getting four star runes from them (but I also just have bad luck).

It took me several months to get my first nat 5, even I know the rates are bad but the fact of this game is that it takes dedication and you need to stick with it to win, people who complain about wasting money are the ones who brought it open themselves, as you are the one who completes the transaction, if you spend money don‚Äôt expect to get an instant nat 5 which is a game changer instantly, just because your dissatisfied doesn‚Äôt mean you can get your money back and trial and error until you are satisfied. I stick to this game because to me in my opinion, com2us has made a very well rounded design to the game that makes it fair to the other players, this makes it enjoyable knowing also the depth of gameplay, the fact that you can multitask by grinding while doing your homework makes it all the better ^_^. I came to write a real review on the game, not a review based on people being frustrated on the rates because they spent money. This game is f2p and it is so very much possible, I have gotten all my nat 5‚Äôs without money (I have 3) I spent money on a legendary scroll pack and got Ludo and even though I don‚Äôt use him much or find value, I won‚Äôt complain.', ""[Com2uS] Hello Summoner!Thank you for leaving us your review!

Thank you for playing Summoners War and best of luck gaming!"", ""It's really fun to play games competitively and to strive to be the best. But that's not really the case for this game. It tries to be that way, but in reality it's just money hungry. Also it relies too much on luck. It's only really a ton of strategy that you have to figure out yourself late game. I know that spending money won't increase your chances of getting a 5 star which seems required for late game, but it makes it so you can have more chances at getting one. See, to do anything you need a nat 5 after necro and toa. Multiple, actually. And it's what, 6 percent chance in legendary scrolls? Less than 1 percent in mysticals? Bull. You should really raise the chances to 6 percent in mysticals like most games usually have. Legendarys to like 15 percent. This game relies on luck too much unless you spend money. And if you reply saying that spending money won't increase your chances, what about all those level 20s in chat with LD nat 5s? Those people obviously spent money. If they didn't and just rushed faimon that would take countless hours because of how trash those rates are. This game is so fun but you just ruin it with the requirement of nat 5s you have late game and how you never get one anyway without spending money. Help some poor people out. This game can really cheer people up with how fun it is especially if they are poor and need something to take away their mind. Don't ruin your game more.

I like a game with lots of grindy content that rewards players for sticking around and persisting in that grind. This is that kind of game.

I have 4 non fusion light/dark nat 5 monsters (the rarest types in the game) and because they are so rare I have to figure out how to use them best. The online guides for this game are awesome, but its way harder to find them for the ultra rare stuff and that makes playing with it more fun! Additionally each account feels unique. The way I play and the way my friends play is different because we have different monsters.The content is a real challenge and there is always something you can build towards - which makes it easy to find a goal and feel like your progressing towards it. I say that and I haven‚Äôt even gotten into the player verses player stuff - which is absurdly difficult.10/10 fun and complex game.

1255466582,"['Although I haven‚Äôt played it for too long, I think that this game has promise. Although it is just ‚Äúanother tower defense game,‚Äù it has some things going for it. It‚Äôs towers are generally more unique from those I‚Äôve seen in other game, especially those of the likes of the laser tower, which can fry enemies from the other side of the map, but requires a lock on a closer enemy in order to do so. Things like this make you think more before you just place a tower. The art design, although minimalistic, is quite appealing and works well. The stages have a good difficulty curve to them, however, some of them become extremely difficult if you stay on the default difficulty, this being hard mode. I have a few recommendations to the developers if they see this review. I personally would like to see some more customization. With how minimal the art style is, it doesn‚Äôt seem like too much trouble to add a level creator or something of the sort. Maybe even a community feature with this. This would probably give the game a lot more replay ability. On top of this, a custom tower creator could be a nice addition too, if you could find a good way to make that happen. If not, just some more tower variety would probably be good. Some better AoE and crowd control towers would be a decent idea. As it is now however, the game is still very good and quite enjoyable. I‚Äôm excited to see what comes of this as well as what your team is capable of.', 'Thank you for your feedback and support! Much appreciated!

This game has impressed me a lot. It totally deserves a 5-star rating.Even though I gave this a full 5 stars, I still do recommend more stuff, for example you could add immune enemies for every tower (you currently only have immune towers for the first 3) and you could add more enemy icons to level creator mode. I also noticed that you were adding a feature in the next update that allows players to create their own tracks, and I think that‚Äôs an AMAZING idea. Also, you could add some more towers, like a high fire-rate tower that costs 100 rings, a high-power tower that costs 150, and a combination of both that costs 250. You could also allow players to buy towers using nanites, if the player doesn‚Äôt have enough rings to pay (the nanite cost should be 10 times smaller than the ring cost. For example, the plasma defender would cost 2 nanites, the laser defender would cost 3, the rocket defender would cost 4, the field generator would cost 5, the Gatling master and shaker would each cost 6, and the Tesla coil would cost 8). You could also allow players to activate abilities with rings if they don‚Äôt have enough nanites, so it would cost 100 rings. Also, players shouldn‚Äôt have to pay EVERY TIME they need to target-lock onto each enemy. Can‚Äôt you just make it a 1-in-10 chance of making you pay a nanite for each time you try to do it?...but still, This game deserves the best!', 'Wow, this are a lot of ideas :) Thank you very much for your feedback and support! We really appreciate it!We will talk about the ideas and keep them in mind for future updates.Your McPeppergames teamwww.ColorDefense.de', 'Color defense is an awesome new take to the classic tower defense genre of games. It‚Äôs simplistic and retrograde design focuses the player on pure strategy in order to defend your space. I was gripped onto this game for hours on end (no joke) as I was determined to complete mission after mission‚Äîthat is, until I reached the 3rd level on the non-tutorial mission. In my experience playing other tower defense type games, this one seems to require the usage of all tower variants including the ‚Äúnanites‚Äù which are a form of in-game currency in order to advance your towers quickly. My only concern is that upon exhausting every last strategy and tower combination, I simply could not beat even the third level without having to slave away at advertisements to obtain ‚Äúnanites‚Äù to bomb my frustrations away. It is well worth noting that the game‚Äôs preset difficult is ‚ÄúHARD‚Äù. I remember seeing in a previous review that the game is meant to be played on ‚ÄúHARD‚Äù, but in my opinion that difficulty is way too unbalanced to be able to play purely by strategy. I may not be the best tower defense player out there, but 4 cumulative hours on the same level trying combination after combination of towers speaks a number on something.All-In-All, an excellent game with an excellent take on a classic‚Äîbut balancing is a major thing in order to have the game at the right challenge level.', 'Thank you for your comment and feedback! Much appreciated! Great you like the game. I have put your feedback to our list of features we are talking about.

On hard mode, it is extremely difficult; I recommend players start on easy or medium.  The game does require creative thinking which must often change with each level, but the basic mechanics are easily learned.  I have now replayed every level numerous times and still enjoy them ‚Äî although I am still looking forward to new levels.I do have a few minor frustrations with mechanics.  It is easy to misclick, and drop a unit in the wrong place.  It is easy to intend to upgrade and instead pick up an unwanted unit.  This is especially true when rushing against the time constraints of completing tasks when needed.  A simple ‚Äúundo‚Äù button (with a 3 or 5 second time limit) could prevent many restarts.I also want to commend the developers for their graceful use of ads which help provide rebound without destroying the enjoyment of the game.  My biggest complaint about the game, however, is something likely beyond the control of the developers.  Perhaps I am old fashioned, but there is one ad that frequently runs that I find very objectionable ‚Äî especially for younger children for whom the game is otherwise well suited.

About halfway through the tutorial levels, I started to think the difficulty was ramping up a little too steeply.

This setting should be made more readily apparent from the get go. I do have some minor issues with the controls on my iPhone X. Quite often, when I go to grab a defender to place, I inadvertently end up closing the app as I drag the defender from the supply bar upwards. When I open the app back up, my unit is uselessly placed right above the supply bar rather than where I intended to put it. I'm sure this will be fixed in future updates, and it wouldn't effect the game on any other devices.

In this game you simply can‚Äôt get the tower to automatically aim at all the guys about to get to the end. Unless you pay. Then you can target one guy for a cost and the towers will probably - probably - aim at it as it approaches the end. Otherwise, they are all aiming at other bad guys way far away from the end. They could easily be aiming at the guys almost at the end but they just are like ‚ÄúNope. I‚Äôm gonna concentrate on this guy that has no chance of reaching the end before those do and end the game.‚Äù But oh, wait! You can PAY to have more big bomb type stuff to drop. It‚Äôs such a blatant and obvious rip off. You can feel the programmers discussing how to get people to pay. I don‚Äôt mind paying normally, but I expect the game to be designed to work intelligently if I don‚Äôt want to pony up extra cash. This one just does the opposite of what any decent tower defense game will do. It lets bad guys get to the end while concentrating on guys who aren‚Äôt even a threat yet. So silly and such a ploy to make cash. I‚Äôve spent $20 for nanites so far and enjoyed the game, but am done. It‚Äôs just too greedy a method to make cash. Yes, let‚Äôs design a tower defense game to act dumb unless the customers keeps paying. Deleting for good.', ""UPDATE:Please note you can get free Nanites by watching rewarded ads in the game.We didn't include the aiming on purpose but just programmed the weapon systems to fire on the first spawned enemies. This brings some new strategical thinking to the game because you also have to think about where and WHEN to place weapon systems to win a level.But as you have mentioned this includes some frustrating moments in some levels where you have to think hard to get the correct strategy. That's why we already have reprogrammed a lot of the enemy wave code, so we can soon add additional aiming features to the game.Please be patient because we have huge plans for the game in 2019 and there will be a lot of cool new stuff.- Chris----Thanks for your comment.

If you‚Äôre looking for something to play while waiting to see a doctor or something to play in general, this game is an excellent choice. It can be challenging too! You really have to strategize in the later levels or else you will likely not get past them. Combining the attack methods of different towers is key to every victory, so don‚Äôt worry about it being too easy. There are difficulty levels as well (easy, normal, hard) and much more content to come!

I can‚Äôt wait for more worlds to be released. Though I do have some concerns (not going to drop to 4 stars because the game is still awesome)1. The Gatling tower still seems incredibly weak, especially compared to the 2 towers you can now switch to. I found no reason at all to choose Gatling over Tesla coil. I really feel it needs a buff for at least its level 8 damage output given it still has a much smaller range than Tesla coil and much less damage for a single target tower.2. Also concerning the new towers, I haven‚Äôt felt the need to use any other towers aside from the one that slows enemies. They‚Äôre far too weak compared to the 2 new towers and the new towers do not have any issues with immunities. I feel level 8 towers of all colors should be as strong as the newer ones are and there‚Äôs should be enemies immune to the new towers to make you have to use different option. Otherwise I can just put 10 Tesla coils down and level up and not have to worry about anything. 3. Endless should now include the new towers and the new targeting system. I went to play endless (since I‚Äôve beaten all levels on hard) and I couldn‚Äôt use any of the new additions.

I don‚Äôt have a clue if certain defenders are stronger against certain colors, or if the unit colors mean nothing.   Also I don‚Äôt know if there are any stacking effects such as anything being smoked by the laser gets a bonus when attacked by other defenders.

The board-game aesthetic, complete with levels (roughly 90 of them) being grouped into fictional Hitman boxes, looks incredible and would easily be convincing as a physical product. When enemies are ‚Äúkilled,‚Äù by you walking your character into theirs or even by picking up a single-use rifle or pair of pistols, their pieces are simply picked up and removed from the game board. (An exception is when certain statues or chandeliers are shot, which fall onto enemies.) Most levels after the wordless but informative tutorials have optional objectives (from pacifism to ‚Äúkill all,‚Äù or making various uses of the environment), and the more you complete, the more level packs you unlock. The only microtransaction I noticed was for additional single-use level-objective solutions, which can be made infinite for $5. They walk you through solving an individual objective step by step, and if you accidentally close out of it, you can reuse that instance of that hint for free. The difficulty curve is rather steep, more so than Lara Croft Go which I also loved and would probably recommend more for inexperienced users, but completing levels in optimal numbers of turns is incredibly satisfying. Highly recommended.', 'This game is a masterpiece. It‚Äôs elegant, simple, and fun! Usually the Hitman series chases realism and other such things. This game is quite the challenge! If you like Hitman, or would like to be introduced to the series, this is a great place to start. And, if you want more after you‚Äôve beaten this, Hitman Sniper is also available! This game is a definite must-have for the best way possible to pass your time. (Does use a good bit of battery though. Recommended for newer phones.)', 'I love the concept. I played the Tomb Raider Lara Croft Go game and needed a hint twice in the entire game. I play this game and I needed 2 hints in 11 levels. There isn‚Äôt enough to figure out on your own. I mean, I usually figure things out pretty well and I‚Äôm good at problem solving. However, this game left me needing help. And when I got that help, it was not something I would have got on my own. This has just too much formula attached to it. By level 6 I already tried every scenario and needed help to get the solution. The solution required backtracking and other tricks. Make it possible to figure out on your own and it will be 5 stars! I love the pieces and the feel of a board game!', 'When it really comes down to it, no matter how much fun you had playing it, the only thing the game had gameplay wise is you swiping your finger to avoid other pieces, sometimes collecting briefcases or throwing items to make noise. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs all you do for the puzzles. And it‚Äôs fun for a bit but the Friday the 13th Puzzle Game has a similar mechanic to the one this has but FOR free. So I‚Äôm paying 5 bucks for a hitman board game skin. Not to mention in that game you FEEL like Jason when chasing campers. I don‚Äôt feel like Hitaman for a lot of these. Just cause my board piece reached the end doesn‚Äôt mean it felt like I did something. I feel like a lot was missed on this, especially for the price tag.', 'Even turning aside from the fact that this has nothing to do with the Hitman franchise other than your gamepiece is a bald man with a suit, the game for what it is (a board puzzle) is pretty tedious.  The ""objective"" is simply to choose one in a web of preset paths, in the right order and in conjunction with throwing an occasional rock, to get to a designated ""end"" point.  The variation between levels is just more numerous and complex placement of guards pieces.  It\'s sort of like a less interesting ""escape the room"" style series where every level is basically the same concept but different location of the key.  Disappointed that they used the Hitman brand just so they could bilk $5 out of fans of the series.', 'This game is so great! I have played completely through it a total of 4 times (100%) and am going again through for a 5th time. It is truly a fantastic game and would completely recommend! Easily one of my top favorite mobile games of all time. Fun, clean puzzles that are the perfect level of challenge. I think this one is the best of the three ‚ÄúGo‚Äù games. MUST PLAY. Only critique is I wish there was a sequel to this!', 'All of the games in the go series are perfect and it‚Äôs really sad to see that the company has moved over to low effort free games that require IAPS to make money. Make quality games and people will buy them I don‚Äôt understand how These developers would abandon a series that earned them game if the year because it wasn‚Äôt profitable makes me mad to see all the toxic free to play games that take zero effort to make', 'If Hitman Go had the gameplay as Deus Go and Tomb Raider Go, I would definitely give this a five star rating. Also, if there was more of a story line to follow too. Tomb raider you know she‚Äôs trying to reach a certain artifact. Deus Go has a story line as well, although I have only played the first level and can already tell I‚Äôm going to like it. The stiff game board play of hitman go gives it a boring feel that‚Äôs not very interactive, especially if you‚Äôve played any of the actual Hitman games in other gaming systems. Maybe this was the first in the Go series? It can definitely use a revamp.', 'I have been playing the Hitman series since I was kid playing on the PlayStation 2. Now I have the newest (2017) hitman game on my ps4, so I know about the Hitman series. This game is a perfect on-the-go game. I was skeptical at first, due to the fact that I didn‚Äôt know how it would be playing a board game- scheme Hitman game. However, this game is great and it still takes some strategy to beat.', 'All you do is just go back and forth trying to avoid these fat dudes or whatever they are. It‚Äôs fluid and not a bad game just not what most people think when they see hitman, maybe change the name to anything but hitman because it leads the purchaser to have an envision of what a hitman game should be like, and it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs like a game of chess but not as fun and makes you think you know what you‚Äôre getting into when you don‚Äôt even know what you are downloading, no hate to the game or the devs but just change the name please, don‚Äôt even change the game, just the name.']"

I‚Äôll try to talk my friends into playing the game but when they see the reviews they are immediately shut down.

606686716,"[""This app is a great way to entice you to visit new places. Unlike other GPS games there is no upkeep, just unlocking new squares, so you don't have to worry about other people stealing your territory of making the app less fun for you. In truth it isn't really a game, just a list of places you've been. The only gamification is the comparing of highscores for different areas which if you follow the spirit if the app won't even matter to you as you'll be exploring new places and uncovering hidden treasures in places you thought you knew well. The best thing that sets Strut above other GPS games is that you can collect tiles without using cellular data, just have wifi on to get the GPS signal (not even connected) and you can upload the tiles when you get home so it won't cost you any extra data!Taking out flight tiles is not about penalizing frequent flyers, it is about making collections more accurate. With flight tracking whole flight paths across the country could sometimes count for multiple cities at once making the leaderboards meaningless.There are a few bugs that make the leaderboards not quite accurate, like a few random tiles counting outside the cities they should. Sometimes tile counts don't sync quite right and the boundaries in rural areas can be way bigger than they should be. So another reason not to take it too seriously."", 'I have been playing this for a couple years, along with a couple other GPS type games. Maybe that‚Äôs the problem.1: I love this game and play it frequently.2: If this app is in the background it is quite likely (not always, but often) to stop recording your tiles until you bring it to the foreground again (or restart it - sometimes bringing it back to the foreground doesn‚Äôt cut it)3: On some of the screens the contrast makes the text absolutely unreadable. Example: the ‚Äúscore‚Äù screen - no matter which of the very limited ‚Äútheme‚Äù options I pick, I cannot read lines 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10.  Why did you make the text dark grey on a slightly darker grey background, in what I swear is 4 pt font???4: the server running this is ridiculously slow. Get used to seeing the spinning equivalent of an hourglass when changing screens.5: I don‚Äôt understand why they even tried to make an Apple Watch app for this. It is broken beyond belief - don‚Äôt even try it. I thought it was because I had a non-cellular Apple Watch - nope. It was equally useless on my cellular Apple Watch.Listen - I like the concept of the game. I still play it (without the Apple Watch) - but a little attention from the developer is sorely needed. I would even pay a small monthly subscription fee for it - but only if the above mentioned issues were resolved. Download it and play it - it is fun - but understand the issues going in.', ""Updating my review after a conversation with the developer. I'm really bummed that this release ends flight tracking, and hope they find a way to bring it back soon. As this is a free app, server costs for storing and analyzing the tens of millions of unlocked tiles has become an issue, and flights are by far responsible for the bulk of unlocked tiles. I hope they can find a way to reduce their overhead and improve the performance of the app.To the people happy that other people's scores are going to drop: think about how other competitive events put participants into classes so that they're ranked against others under similar conditions. It's not unfair that other people fly more than you, there just needs to be a way to separate the participants. The obvious solution to me here is to work with the data in Strut to present multiple leaderboards: one including flight data and one without. This would satisfy everyone, and keep in place the effort that people have put in place to track their data for years. Frequent flyers in Strut enjoy competing against each other too. Remember the race to 1 million tiles?Still one of my favorite apps out there, it's just going through growing pains now."", 'I love maps and exploration.

Even if you adjust the options to show more map, you will only get a ghostly, faded image.Also, rather than ‚Äòclearing‚Äô a single street, the world is divided into tiles - and all it takes to light one up is to step on it (or drove, fly over, etc).I spent many a happy afternoon sitting in front of Final Fantasy, Zelda, Dragon Warrior and other top-down, 8-bit games, controller in one hand and pencils in the other, coloring in squares on graph paper and watching the huge fantasy worlds grow.

I‚Äôm in love with this app! While you don‚Äôt HAVE to upgrade or buy add-ons to enjoy this even into the later levels, after a month or so I loved it so much that I bought the auto-feeder and coin exchange option, and the extra ($12 I think?) made all the difference. It really improves the fun factor! $12 for over 150 hours of entertainment is totally worth it! As for the game itself, its usability is great. It‚Äôs aesthetically appealing on every screen, and the graphics are fantastic! I love the sounds, too; they‚Äôre relaxing. I also love that you can hide all menu options and view just the tank. I have a very stressful call center job and sometimes just have one of my tanks displayed on my workstation. I would love to see some more vegetation options for the saltwater tanks, though. The freshwater ones can be green and lush but the saltwater decor options are mostly rocks and statues. The ocean tanks also don‚Äôt have many options for backgrounds. I also don‚Äôt think you can have friends or use their tanks without logging into Facebook. In the past with other games, you could log onto the game center thing and search for other users and request friendships. I‚Äôd love that function with Fish Farm! Maybe these things will change later. :) For now, I‚Äôm totally happy!', ""I‚Äôm in love üòç with the game!!! Graphics are 100% amazing üòâ when you zoom they really hold up no glitches. Breeding is super fast, and the new ray update is so cool! One thing I would change is how you sell fish. I wish it was a multi player game. Like selling fish to a friend and you could see their aquariums and chat. Compete in shallow run with friends even trading fish, and selling each other fish. Also you should have to be at level five before you can send a link to a friend. And just people you know. So you have to have their phone number through messenger or something. That is my only request multi player. Oh and let me say treating this game like you have real aquariums works better because your fish done go hungry. Feed them before bed and in the morning and after noon. (Normal fish keeping) I also noticed that if you do a daily water change your fish don't get sick like they would in real life because of the hormones in the water I think that‚Äôs nice so please don‚Äôt change that. I believe it‚Äôs a nice way of teaching people how to take care of fish. Five stars ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è final review."", 'This really is a 5 star game. It‚Äôs amazing. They get 1 star deducted automatically because of the way in app purchases affect the game. You know, when it starts to feel too much like real life trying to get ahead.  Many games are like this. Many games aren‚Äôt 5 start games. It didn‚Äôt bother me too much actually. I even spent money (more than i usually do $6) and felt good because they made a high quality game. I stoped playing for a bit, my water hadn‚Äôt been changed soon enough and my fish are sick. Too be expected, but to cure them I need to spend cowries (this games version of high level currency. You know how in app purchase games use different currencies so that the systems get you to pay real money) it is extremely expensive.  It really should be coins that you pay with. It makes me not want to play anymore because it‚Äôs stressful (like real life) you get that same feeling of being overcharged for medical expenses(like real life) and therefore I really don‚Äôt need that in a game. So they loose another star. I‚Äôm tempted to take another one away because I‚Äôm bitter that I felt good about giving them money only to find this out. But it actually is a really good game.Its just a 10 dollar game. You gotta by the auto everything to prevent this. That‚Äôs kinda pricey for a mobile game...', ""I was a big fan of Fish Farm 2 and I'm loving the new version! The fish are beautiful and move realistically enough to create a nice illusion of a fish tank. The decorations are especially an improvement over the previous version, though they still don't have as nearly as much realism as the fish themselves. I really like the new lights, as they add more customisation to your tanks. My only small complaint is I miss being able to change the pitch of the bubble sound. I liked having the bubbles in Fish Farm 2 set to a very low pitch as that was much more relaxing. It would be great to have that feature back in in a future update. And also it would be nice if the arrow in the corner when you're doing a fullscreen view of your tank could fade out after a few seconds and reappear when you tap the screen again. Having it always visible disrupts the tank illusion a bit. Other than that, it's an excellent app, though I know it is very frustrating if you want it to remain free. But for me it was worth investing a little money in the add-ons to get more enjoyment out of it, especially since I already loved the previous one."", 'Love it. Just watching the fish is great. One major issue: You are expected to feed your fish every 12 hours (or less). I don\'t actually know how long it takes them to get ""sick"" after they\'ve gone hungry from not being fed for 12 hours, but the game doesn\'t tell you. It\'s just way too demanding. Instead of simply not growing, once they are sick you have to use the ""cowry"" currency to heal them (or sell them all for zero coins and hope you have enough coins to restart). You have options to get that currency without paying, but they are time consuming or inefficient. There are other ways to use that currency that feel more fair and exciting, like buying special fish. But if you buy those special fish and didn\'t have time to feed them, then you\'re back to healing your sick fish. Not forgiving to people who put the game down for 2-3 days, or longer.', 'I wish you could also catch whales, dolphins, sharks, seahorses, turtles, and rays because on the reef option you see an illustration of a huge whale along with the illustrations of the other fish you can catch but even after you unlock the ocean tanks and the whales, sharks, dolphins, and etc. you can NOT catch one in the game! The illustration is just misleading and if other players are like me it gets your hopes up just to be disappointed.üò¢Another improvement that I would love would be the ability to transfer data from androids to iOS because I was happy to finally get an iPhone with better visuals just to realize that I couldn‚Äôt get back any of my progress I went from level 65 to level 0 when I have been playing fish farm since the very first game came out ( for YEARS)! It was just really discouraging, I almost didn‚Äôt want to play anymore but I guess because of the new 5x faster affect and the higher values on fish I‚Äôve been leveling up pretty fast I‚Äôm currently on level 18 with 5 tanks ( I‚Äôd still prefer my previous game that I‚Äôve worked so hard on .

It would be nice to be able to catch ocean creatures for a tank so you don‚Äôt have to spend ridiculous amounts of money to buy them.

It also has great SFX during gameplay, which goes very nicely with the background music!Overall art style, animations, and character designs are incredible and stand out from other match-3 type games. The art style of the Ducks themselves kinda remind me of the new DuckTales (2017) series, which is a plus for me anyway even if that style wasn‚Äôt intentional. ^u^The game gets somewhat challenging as you play through, but at appropriate amounts.

I expected that there would be a different disco song for each level, or maybe a variety within each level, not just one throughout the entire game for every level. What a shame: There are so many wonderful disco songs that were written. Another reason I gave it only 4 stars is because this app, like so many apps, tries to maneuver everyone into buying more and more boosters and coins. Although it is not as ruthlessly misleading and expensive to play as many other apps, it is nonetheless still aggressively deceptive. Also, like so many other apps today, you should not let kids who don‚Äôt know any better play it unsupervised. They might end up generating a $500 bill. Warn the kids. Lastly, if the player takes enough time, he or she can learn how to win the levels without spending a lot. Given enough time, the player can even learn to win without using the boosters, however a lot of boosters are offered at certain times free of charge during play.

The AI is pretty predictable, though, once you\'ve played enough games.

There are some rule bugs such as AI players on rare occasions closing off or blocking all of their open doorways, or being able to collect the corridor room completion bonus twice in one turn. The AI players also have a very annoying quirk of pricing very valuable rooms (i.e. king\'s favor bonuses) very low so the other AI players can buy them cheap, and somehow knowing which rooms are valuable for me (based on my secret bonus cards) and pricing them very high- almost seems like cheating at times. Don\'t get me wrong though, I do enjoy playing the app a lot, despite some annoying quirks.Some things I\'d like to see in a future update: a cleaner, tidier interface (it\'s hard to see the scores as they pop up, and avoid having parts of the interface cover large portions of the board); smarter, adjustable AI; INTERNET MULTIPLAYER; a digital rule book for new players (the tutorial isn\'t very helpful).', 'This app is great except for one huge issue, it does not have online multiplayer.

532024361,"[""This game is definitely worth the 5 bucks to play, especially if you have friends that will get it with you as well. It's like a fantasy version of risk. Every match is unique due to the amount of variation the game presents. You can play against AI, other people, or both. The AI matches alone would still make this an enjoyable game, but being able to play against other players is what really sold me on this. There's a lot of strategy involved but the game is simple enough for anyone to pickup after 30 or so minutes of playing. The downsides of the game are that each match is a commitment taking on average about 5 hours of your time to complete, this isn't a huge issue as you can sit the game down and pick it back up where you left off at your leisure, and the matchmaking could greatly be improved. If you don't have anyone to invite to a PVP game then you're forced to match up with a random person. You can't just search for a match though, you click the type of game you want to play and you hit start. If there is a match already created then you join that one but if there's not then you do your turn 1 and basically just have to hope someone eventually gets matched into your game.

These include: 1) no option for enhanced gameplay so armies can be produced faster than normal, 2) there is no option to view all battles (either com vs com or human vs com), or opt to see only battles that involve your armies, making it less obvious which forces survived or didn‚Äôt survive battles, 3) the difficulty settings for the computer are either knight, lord, or warlord, missing the Baron setting in between knight and lord difficulties, 4) you don‚Äôt get a report or text box after capturing or losing a city of how much gold you won/lost, and 5) when you conquer all other enemies, you cannot really explore the rest of the map as the ‚ÄòEnd Turn‚Äô button is grayed out, meaning you cannot rest and regain movement (this is probably a glitch more than anything, but it makes it deflating somewhat when you do win).

At the same time, the dice are skewed against the player who will now, also with too great frequency, miss a point that has only a single opponent\'s chip on it, miss a point that only has a single player\'s chip on it, and roll very low numbers that slows the player\'s progression across the board.YOU NEED TO DO BETTER', 'The mechanics of this game malfunction way too much.

My allies will not use artillery and not attack for turn after turn and then as soon as I invade, my ally decides to attack. I know in one of the responses the developer made in another review that was intentional, but the thing is the AI never accidentally attacks an ally, so even if it is intentional, it‚Äôs at least flawed. In one scenario, I was playing as Germany in WW2 and my only ally is Italy, but I‚Äôm in a pact with the soviets. As the game progresses both the soviets and I invade the same Balkan region, so there goes that pact. Then the Swedes and the Spanish join the allies, and guess what Italy and I both invade a French region, so no more allies for me. It happens every game so it ends up being me vs everyone everytime.', ""Hi Paeon me, Thank for your review. In War in Europe alliances do not change.  Once you are in an alliance that is it, it never changes. If you happen to attack the same land that your ally has just taken, then you may lose some troops but your both still allies. Pacts are different they can be broken at any time, In the WW2 scenario Italy and Germany are locked in an alliance that never changes. France and Britain are locked in an alliance. Spain, Sweden, and Turkey are neutral at the start of the game and will join one of the alliances at some stage and when they do they are stuck in that alliance. I think your  report of events are an inaccurate account of what happened. I also don't understand why I would intentionally make your ally attack you?  I suggest you read the rules and try playing the game again and see exactly what happens the turn after you have a clash with an ally. It's not the end of the game, it has happened to us all, good luck. John "", 'Hi I enjoyed your game while I first thought it boring because you‚Äôre stuck in Europe. This game grabbed my attention as it is the ONLY GAME THAT HAS THE ABLITY TO FORM ALLIANCES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME AND FORM THREE OR MORE! Which makes up for the annoying repeat events because it creates new ideas! Using custom game I have built games starting with alliances and have neutrals that can join in (America in Spain is my favorite one). When you create the Pacific map please keep this concept! Oh and include Indonesia üáÆüá© the island country because while it didn‚Äôt exist until after WW2 at least. Having a middle island based country balancing japan üáØüáµ China üá®üá≥ and Australia üá¶üá∫s aggression out means less of a frenzy and more diplomacy in the pacific. When you create the WW2 game you will need to include Africa and North America at least and knowing your style you will make South America so reuse your Europe and pacific Maps and build off of them. It will save time and ultimately the Europe was very well done so keep it! I understand buying the custom mode but when you make WW2 or pacific please have free for all allowed off the bat or at least more wars that allow alliances and neutrals to join to a side! Also sense you have 12 in Europe and 5 (counting America) for sure in pacific please keep all the sides it would be awesome to see 5 vs 5 vs 5 or something like that in WW2 being possible by sides joining. Thank you for your hard work!', ""Hi, and thanks for your great review. I have decided to create an entire new game called 'Colonies at War' which will expand on WIE and have the entire world to play in. Please visit my website/in development, and you can read more about it. I do hope you will like CAW as much as WIE when it is out (mid to late 2021). JohnG"", 'This game is a lot like axis and Allies I bought axis and Allies on my steam account and I played it and the game is OK you see axis and Allies you have to conquer the entire map to win the game or better yet you have to just conquer all the cities in Europe which isn‚Äôt very realistic but when I played it war in Europe I learned that when you conquer most of the map it automatically tells you how many casualties there how long the war was even though this game does not have the best graphics the gameplay is amazing trying to figure out how many soldiers do you need to send to fight off a heavily fortified base or using very few troops to take over a week base I think this is perfect for any strategic game because in risk and axis and allies there is no bass you just have to have more troops and then you win the game you have to be strategic about how to use for example  tanks are good because I can take down a lot of men without being severely damaged until artillery shows up then they can be severely damage another thing about the artillery is instead of in like axis and allies as were you if you use artillery it automatically get destroyed. In this game though you can use artillery over and over again without being destroyed and it takes down forts. This game is really fun and it deserves more attention. Thanks for reading this.', 'Hi rain ho guy, Thanks for you great review! Its nice to know that there are like-minded people out there. I made this game because there was nothing on the smart phones that tactically interested me. So I decided to make my own game. Thanks again for the positive review. JohnG', 'First off this game is 10/10 amazing and entertains me a lot in my spare time. However I think the game needs more smaller countries more tiles and also more smaller wars. Another thing when I play in the free-for-all can people be more open to becoming allies with me I will literally be the strongest nation in the world and no one will Ally with me. The thing that I would be most happy about adding to this game it‚Äôs probably adding onto World War II and World War I. For example, in World War I and World War II when the Americans join in, could support be given to Britain? Also, it says that America sends over convoys; could there be something to do with the U-boat problem and not all the convoys arrive to Britain. And I don‚Äôt really care if this happens or not but could you pan been included as something you can swipe the screen over to to see if they‚Äôre making progress invading Russia just give the Soviet union a little more trouble?Because they always completely sweep through Europe. Anyways, where are you at these things or not I still love the game and that‚Äôs why I rate this game five stars. Oh I also forgot to add, can you carry ships two other ports, for example if I‚Äôm Germany and I invade The British Isles can I please put my ships into London‚Äôs harbors?', 'Hi backstabbing productions, Thanks for the review, if Russia is alway winning then you should change your tactics (if you Britain), when I am Britain I always let them fight a little until one gets too strong then I attack him! I intend to make a bigger War in Europe in the future. Thanks JG', 'The sequence of the turn is all players make their combat moves without knowing what other players are doing. Then combat happens but its sequential, not concurrent so sometimes you end up attacking allies. Example: You are Britain and you attack the territory of Germany. France also attacks Germany. The French battle is first and they win. Then your battle occurs and your troops attack the French occupying force costing both Britain and France troops. Instead the battle should have been the combined French British force for a more decisive victory. At the very least when Britain ‚Äúattacks‚Äù there should be no battle. Either the two forces should coexist or the British forces should turn back. Different example: If there are two territories controlled by opposing forces when each side chooses to send an attack across the border the forces don‚Äôt clash in the middle, they pass each other and only attack whatever forces we left to defend. Dumb! Also apparently you cannot sail your warships into waters controlled by allies. So it is possible for your navy to be bottled up in a few sea zones because your ally controls the surrounding seas.EDIT IN REPLY TO DEVELOPER RESPONSE: Sorry but these flaws aren‚Äôt features that prevent the game from being complicated, they are fatal flaws.  Allies should never unintentionally attack each other and allies should not box in each others navies.  These are fatal flaws in your game.', 'Hi, this is a light game and is not designed to be over complicated. This is what most people want in a iPhone game. You should try to play the more comprehensive games like ColoniesAtWar or FrenchIndianWar. John', 'Hello! I absolutely love this game. I always try to play it during my free time just to challenge my brain. I have literally no fault in the besides like 1 or 2 things. 1: I really hate that if you‚Äôre in an Alliance (Let‚Äôs day Great Britain and France, in both WW1 and WW2), and you‚Äôre playing as France, Britain can just go in and block the Gibraltar Straight, and leave your Troops in North Africa. I think a way to fix that would be to let you move through your Allies‚Äô territory. That might be hard for the system to understand, but that‚Äôs just a suggestion. 2: I wish there were more countries to play as. I think Italy in WW1 is a must, and I would put them on the Allied side. Also, Poland in WW2, so you can try and hold off both invasions, or just playing as Finland or Spain. I think those areas would help the game grow. Other then that, I absolutely love this game. I recommend it to all that enjoy WW2 board games, as well as just Strategy games in general.*Update*Just saw the Custom Game, and that you can play as America, as well as all the new game modes, and oh how I love you so. I have found one glitch however. In the last ‚ÄúChallenge‚Äù Mission, which is the Austrian-Prussian War, Italy is completely disabled. You cannot attack Italy, and the entire country is the Brown tiles. Other then that This game is so much more in depth then I thought. Thank you so much for listening to your reviews btw.', 'Hi Jimmee Legs185, Thanks for the review, unfortunately I cannot make counties more their armies through other nations lands, for me to do that I would have to re-code the whole game. You just have to accept it and consider that this hinders the enemy as well so it all balances out in the end. I have just added more nations in the next v7.90 update. Try French Indian war as this game has armies that can move amongst other armies. John. ', 'First of all this game is perfect for me i had played it since i bought in 3 years but with the recent updates the problems started to appear, one of Them is that ever i wanted to play as germany ww1 in hard difficulty, i automatically lose i mean not even 1 turn in the game thats a serious issue there and the other one is that when i want to see the game rules i Simply can‚Äôt because  the screen of the letter or the background is black, i‚Äôm expecting that the developers can solve this problems so that i can continue enjoing This great game , please Let me now if i made myself clear if not sorry for my bad english.', 'HI  Octavio bruzzone,Please email me with bugs, this form of communication is very slow and frustrating. I am working on these bugs now but this always happens when a big update is released. again please email me your bugs as I am not sure your problem. John Thanks for the review, I do have war in the pacific on my list. I just wish I could get them out sooner. JG', 'I like the game and it has great potential, but it‚Äôs too flawed and weird. For example, if I attack B with all my forces from A and end my turn, it will interpret A as empty since all my troops are attacking B. This means that if AI B attacked my forces in A and their attack turn goes first, they will automatically take territory A and my forces attacking B die immediately. This is really frustrating and doesn‚Äôt even make sense.   Another problem is the unlimited movement. This factor makes it incredibly hard to predict enemy moves and attacks, since they can simply move all their troops anywhere on the battlefield. It would make more sense for there to be rails that can be damaged, or atleast limited movement for armies.    Lastly, the WW1 scenario is too hard on the allies. Russia, specifically. Russia‚Äôs infantry are horrid, so it‚Äôs in their best interest to defend to the last or slowly retreat to Moscow. Any counterattacks or offenses by Russia will be shortlived or unsuccessful, as they don‚Äôt have the manpower or time to do so.  Russia‚Äôs best bet is defence. But, even if Russia manages to survive the first wave, they simply lose half of their soldiers and territory to the Bolsheviks. It‚Äôs game over from there. My suggestion is making it so there is requirements in order for the revolution to happen. This gives the allies a fighting chance. Dude, I love the game and it‚Äôs pretty neat, but please solve some of these problems.', ""Hi Lolzrev, thanks for your long comment, Now, if Land A leaves his land unprotected and attacks Land B he will loose everything if Land B attacks Land A before Land A's attack happens and if Land A's forces fail to win the battle for Land B. So imagine sending your entire army to attack another land but you fail to win that battle, so your retreating army must find another place to go, if the land you just had is lost(because you did not defend it) and if there is no other land (owned by you) adjacent to the land you just attacked then your whole army will die.  I think that's fair. Movement...well.. it is what it is...I think it works well for this size game.Yes, Russia is impossible to win, not all countries are winnable. So long as the Allies can hold the seas then they can win. I play Russia with some financial aid (after the revolution) then you have a chance."", 'Finished the game including WW1 and WW2. seriously and i ain‚Äôt just saying this - Mr developers i been looking for a game like this since i had my phone. it‚Äôs gr8      no complaints and much looking forward to the next strategic war game u create.   ideas even though they have probably already crossed ur mind r American Revolution, America Colonization. and american civil war. hope to c these. thanks for the joy of the game.came back to add a few constructive criticism things.       i found out it‚Äôs one developer doing all this so to u mr developer bravo. absolutely my fav game ever.      however i wish the diplomacy was changed a little. such as i can move my british soldiers into french soil and have them stay there instead of fighting my ally.', ""Hi Ricka_The_Tricksta, Thanks for your great review, good timing because I have eventually finished my next game and it should be out 2nd week of June2020, cross fingers!

Not great honestly. European War 4 had so much potential. I remember opening it up when it first came out, and starting a Conquest game as France. Which I couldn't finish because of the turn limit.

Every ship has a unique playing style with special weapons plus having about a dozen in game weapon pickups that are permanent as long as you have enough gems for energy really adds excitement to the gameplay. I love how you are rewarded for bumping into enemies. You can upgrade your main weapon/weapons 5 times and as long as you keep it at level 5, the next upgrade power-up will give you a shield that is permanent until hit by enemy weapon. If you can keep the shield, you are rewarded with more bombs with the upgrade power-ups. I also like how the bosses rotate for variety and get harder as the game progresses. The enemies and bullets get harder also but the progression is slow and steady which allows for long playing time per game (unless you play hard difficulty). The controls and general feel of the game is smooth and the old school pixelated graphics are nice.

Current problem I have been having in multiple leagues which has caused me to have to contact multiple managers along with the commissioners to fix is the trading. If trades are accepted while a manager has enough roster spots to take a 2 for 1 trade it will allow the trade to go through. If that same manager picks someone up in the following 2 days before the trade is processed, that trade basically becomes vetoed/unsuccessful because now they would have needed to drop someone and that wasn‚Äôt in the original trade. Because of this, on game days I am having to scramble with managers and commissioners to go back thru and have them push the trades through. These teams basically can have buyers remorse and do this PURPOSELY to void trades they no longer agree with. This NEEDS to be fixed by app developers as it has caused many headaches throughout the year. Again, this is one of the best fantasy apps minus this loop hole for buyers remorse. Make it so the person getting two players has chances or options to have someone dropped before the entire trade ends up in the toilet and managers with buyers remorse don‚Äôt get a chance to back out of deals unfairly.', 'I would just like to say how much I enjoy this sight for Fantasy Football.

The other thing, for example, Mike Williams hasn‚Äôt played a game in weeks yet every single week I can‚Äôt add a guy until I pull Williams out of IR (which requires me to drop someone) because his designation changes every Tuesday to questionable. Yahoo should keep a player designated as ‚Äúout‚Äù until they are designated as ‚Äúactive‚Äù so managers can add another player without losing a bench spot. Also, a ‚Äúbye‚Äù bench spot would be awesome too! Give managers the option to add these bench spots into their leagues and let us decide which ones we would like to implement.

It‚Äôs a great resource for players across all leagues to ask questions and have conversations about players they share. Idk if it‚Äôs only present during pre-season or if they took it off. Regardless it needs to be permanent.2) Team photos need to be bigger. The guys in my fantasy league pride our selves with coming up with hilarious team names and use photoshop to make hilarious photos for our teams. But the circle for photos is so small it‚Äôs too hard to see them. They need to enlarge the size of the circle for team photos.

In yahoo you have to actually get money to get money do your technically losing money if you lose.

When I‚Äôm playing a team I lost one game because the scores glitches.

Additionally, you can subscribe to the diamond membership which I really don‚Äôt think it that worth it, but if you do, you get a free 3 day trial and it even gives you the option to unsubscribe though the app which I think is the best PtE out there. A lot of other apps don‚Äôt actually tell you how to unsubscribe to things and I love how this game lets you know. You get a free car out of it as well which is a lot more than other games give you.

Recently I tried to download it but there is a new official version that is an ad nightmare, and the only way to get rid of them is to buy gems to unlock. Pure crap.This game does not suffer from that insanity, it is a straightforward game that I have come to enjoy for short interludes of world conquest. The controls are easy enough to learn though I do sometimes miss the ‚ÄúFortify‚Äù button and end a turn by mistake. Also, when asked about ‚Äúcashing‚Äù in cards for armies, the board is erased of army counts, making it harder to decide if cashing in is necessary or worthwhile to begin a run of capturing all of another color.', 'Lots of maps, game modes, rulesets, and AI skill levels means you can customize the game pretty much however you could please. No IAP means it‚Äôs safe for the kids too, and will help them build strategic mindsets if you teach them to watch and mimic the Reaper AI play style.My only issue with it is the audio level is permanently bound to the main sound level so if you want to quiet down the explosions you end up doing so for the whole phone, which can lead to issues if you forget (it also mutes itself off the lock switch). You can disable the sound effects outright but the sound design has some useful audio cues for when your thumbs are hiding info. It‚Äôd be nice to have a game audio slider option not bound to main volume.', ""I've played Risk for many years as a board game and on a desktop computer. Many versions in the early 2000s were pretty clunky and slow and browser based ones seemed too slow, spammy, or basic. But this iOS version Lux DLX is speedy, highly configurable, and comes with lots of maps. If you feel like just smashing the opponents, you can make the AIs very easy to beat. But if you set all opponents to reaper mode, it's very difficult. And you can vary up the opponent skills and the number you face. You can run the game at different speeds by limiting the graphics and by automatically rolling dice and  moving pieces. It's never the same game twice. I've played this Lux DLX for a year or two now and have rarely encountered glitches. Very well put together game!"", 'This incarnation of the classic Risk game is pretty ideal, I think.  I use all the AI players, but I leave them all set to ""Random"" as far as ability.  I win about 25% of the time, which is only slightly better than I would fare with human players.  It takes about 15 minutes to play a game, which is perfect.  And I like that after I am eliminated, the game proceeds in accelerated mode so that I can see who finally wins the game.  There are lots of maps available, but I stick with the classic World map.  I\'ve played a number of ""Risk"" apps, but this one is clearly the best.  And after the initial purchase price of the app, there are no ads or in-app purchase options.  You buy the complete uninterrupted game.  Kudos to the developers.  Really nice job.', 'It‚Äôs a great game, and fun, basically a board game for strategists that stays interesting. Though a few complaints I have are that the win is 90% in favor of the defender, so if I have 3 divisions, and the defender has 2, he/she will win, every single time. This carries on to another complaint, if I had an army of 2, and an army of another 2, and I attack a 3, then I will lose the first time, then I attack with my other army, and same result, this is constructive criticism, but I believe you should add an unseen ‚Äúhealth‚Äù system where I could attack a 3 with a 2, and then attack with a 1 and win.

I know I\'m not the only one who has noticed.Is it a glitch, a way to make the game harder, or is it just inevitable?After playing and beating it a few times a message pops up that\'s says ""Like it or Lux it"" and after that it seems like the game becomes progressively more difficult. As if if you don\'t like the game on Facebook, the game starts cheating. For example, I can start a battle with 25 armies against say 7 and if it\'s against ""reaper"" it\'s like I\'m rolling with less di, which makes the game not fun. I should NOT lose those battles as often as I should. 95% of the time I should win those, but it only happens about 70% of the time. If that\'s what you do to make the game more difficult (give the computer opponents more dice) then don\'t even bother making it harder because the game becomes so frustrating that you want to smash your phone with a hammer.

I‚Äôm hoping they‚Äôre joking because that is a really big let down for anyone playing the game. On top of that the rotation of gear in this game is much to quick for the investment it takes to get your gear to top tier.

So currently, I am still enjoying the game, and the devs have implemented some really beneficial mechanics and events, but I can‚Äôt help but notice the increasing pressure to spend money (and spend it in increasing amounts) on this game.

Unfinished sections, repetitive battle event, far too much pay to play.

They had something unique and fun, something many of us worked hard to be good at, and they scrapped it for a match 3. They infested what‚Äôs left with more quests and even MORE pay to play. I have no words. I haven‚Äôt deleted it just yet out of sheer blind hope that they‚Äôll realize how badly they ruined this game and change it all back before it‚Äôs too late.', ""Hi. We understand where this idea of similarity is coming from, however, although our current gameplay may look like match 3, it‚Äôs actually a completely different mechanism, based on choosing the right combination of talents.

I got the same epic items that I already had! Not 1 single legendary piece!! I cant help but feel gipped, as the cost went up with each draw! *they need a better percent to hit better or atleast different gear.* Thats my take on it.', 'Hello.

They‚Äôll really ruined a good thing that they had going. Also, take a minute to check out the other developer comments. Half of them are the same copy and pasted response. Deserves zero stars.Previous review: There is a shield mechanic that makes no sense. You now have to upgrade spells in addition to upgrading your gear and your orbs, which is a complete waste of time. In the old version you could get to the end of the campaign in a reasonable amount of time. It still took hours but at least you felt like you were progressing. Not every player has a million hours to spend towards a game endlessly grinding away to see any sort of progress or accomplishment. Some of us just want a game where 10-20 hours makes a markable difference. The old version of the game allowed character growth every day you played. Now it‚Äôs going to take hours and hours to achieve even a fraction of the leveling that you could in the old version. Huge misstep by the game creators and a huge waste of time.', ""Hi. Thank you for sharing your thoughts on the recent update. We know that there are a lot of changes in the game and they can seem overwhelming at first, but don't get discouraged by all the new features. They are actually quite easy to understand once you get to know them and can be less time-consuming. Just give them a try. Thank you very much for your feedback!"", 'Questland is a great rpg game. No matter what, there‚Äôs always something you can do in the game, so you can never get stuck. The game is also very pretty, and the storyline is cool. However, there are some things that frustrate me. You get lots of parts that you know you wont create weapons with. I wish we could boost specific gear with it. Like, if you already have that gear, you could boost your gear with the gear part. It wouldn‚Äôt be boosted as much as a full gear, but it seems wasted having all this gear parts and knowing you won‚Äôt get enough to make a full piece of gear.Another thing that frustrates me is the chests. In the golden chest, you should be more likely to get epic gear, because even though it says its more likely then the silver chest, it still almost never happens. And with the eternal chest, the rare items should be taken out, or at least less likely to get them. I‚Äôve spent thousands of gems hoping for epic or legendary but i always get rare and it frustrates me. Also,', 'Overall, this is a fun time wasting RPG that only requires as much effort as you want to invest. Here‚Äôs my thoughts:You can set battle to manual, auto, or just skip the battle altogether and let the computer figure out who won. You are rated in stars based on number of actions taken in the battle, so the only risk is the AI may not be as efficient as you are, and you may lose a star. Level up a little and it‚Äôs no problem. CON: The combat is a bit repetitive and the only reason it‚Äôs not 5 Star.You‚Äôll be farming gold and eternium constantly to upgrade gear. Luckily it‚Äôs dropped in every level.Every level costs 1 energy so far, so 30 goes a long way. They also provide with a lot of refills to get started.You get at least 10 max level chests the first hours of playing. I pulled two legendary items already without spending a dime. Unfortunately it was the same one twice. They have a system to combine duplicates, so nothing was wasted!Unless you want to speed up progress, There‚Äôs no need to invest money to get legendary items from chests and you collect premium currency pretty easily doing dailies.The guild building and social aspects look strong and I hope to find a good one to explore this further.It‚Äôs worth a try if you like this kind of thing.', 'I have had a lot of fun with this game so far.  Collecting equipment, figuring out the blacksmith formulas, etc.  I actually think the latest update is an interesting twist rather then just having the game be a screen smashing rpg.  However, I have a couple issues.1) The seems to be a big imbalance of the ‚ÄúSpirits‚Äù to where you get stuck with the exact same spirits over and over in a fight.  Not sure if I‚Äôm alone in this, or if it‚Äôs a gamewide issue.2) Wasn‚Äôt a fan of the fact that my progress in the story got pushed back as far as it did and for the difficulty of the campaign to be cranked up as high.  I had actually gotten fairly invested in the storyline (especially considering it‚Äôs a mobile game) but now I‚Äôm pushed to half of what my progression was and can‚Äôt even get 1 Star on some levels because my power was cut down so much.  Not sure I‚Äôm willing to grind as much just to continue the story.  We‚Äôll see.', ""Hi. Thank you for reaching out to us and sharing your thoughts on the recent update. The new mechanism is a strategic battle choice that require our players to know the enemy's weakness, strength of certain talents, differences between talent‚Äôs skills and the right choice when it comes to equipped weapons‚Äô passive skills.

869341551,"['Now I like to read through people‚Äôs comments before getting a game just because they have good input and usually can help you from downloading a game that you might have thought looked good but actually wasn‚Äôt your style or a game that shows all this cool stuff then tries to squeeze every last dollar,quarter,nickel,dime, and penny from your wallet. When I read through these comments I knew that it wouldn‚Äôt bombard you with ads and make you pay money for easy wins, but there was a lot of complaining about the levels being too difficult and that you have to buy stuff with real money to actually do them. They‚Äôre wrong. All it takes is a little strategy and some determination and for me that gets me to win anything and everything with no real cash involved. So if your looking for a good time spender and something to do when there is nothing else to do, that isn‚Äôt impossible but won‚Äôt let you speed through it instantly get this game, you won‚Äôt regret it.', 'High replayability value. Takes some time to advance but if you‚Äôre patient you don‚Äôt need to spend money. Wish more games would follow this model instead of jamming ads in after every level. Game crashes pretty regularly when loading levels, maybe every half-dozen levels or so, but my iPad is ancient so it could just be me.', 'Nice enough game, until you‚Äôve played for a little while, and suddenly it says you have to wait 10 minutes to play again, or pay them money.Is there something about that that‚Äôs supposed to be fun for me as a player? No, there isn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs just a developer trying to make an unlimited amount of money off of selling a game once.I‚Äôd be happy to spend a couple of bucks upfront on a decent TD game, but a ‚Äúfree‚Äú game, that makes you wait 10 minutes between games for absolutely no reason at all except as a cash grab by the developer? no thanks. Too bad, it was a fun little game for 20 minutes, for a couple of bucks instead of pay-and-pay-and-pay-and-pay-to-play, it would‚Äôve been a five star game for sure. Deleted now. Also, one other annoyance, the playfield is slightly bigger than the screen so you constantly have to scroll to see if you‚Äôre missing anything. And a whole bunch of times I tried to drag out a tower, but it suddenly appeared on a totally different part of the playfield that I didn‚Äôt release it on.', 'Nice little game! The visuals are great and the mechanics are relatively simple. The humor included on the panels in loading screens was unexpected but most certainly welcome as well! The only drawback is the difficulty spike seems a bit steep. It could just seem that way to me because I can‚Äôt wait to see what the game will throw at me next level. The prices of upgrades within the game keep it from going too fast also, but they incentivize smart play to get three stars on each level. I‚Äôm loving it so far. Good job Devs!!', 'You have to pay. So let‚Äôs get that out there. We‚Äôre talking about like 2 to 5 bucks.  You will get to a certain level where it just dumps healing bots and they walk through all your defense and into your base.

You can get enough diamonds to upgrade enough of your towers to hold everything back. I am at the point where they are walking through everything‚Ä¶. Again. (And yes, everything us upgraded)', 'Very well thought out TD with nice art work and a creative storyline. I liked the fact that each challenge was like a chess game. You had to analyze who the enemy was and which towers and weapons were optimized for those enemies. If you are patient, you can earn credit by replaying previous levels. Overall fun and enjoyable. Looking forward to the next one.', 'Developers do an incredible job of luring you in so you get hooked and then need to spend $$$ to advance. I‚Äôm at about $15 and only on the fourth map out of 9. On the 4th map the towers I just spent $15 upgrading are useless and they make you use boosts or weapons to advance. Well guess what? If you haven‚Äôt spent even more $$$ on those upgrades you get slaughtered. I don‚Äôt mind spending a few bucks on a game but these developers are greedy. Hence the 3 stars.', 'This is a good tower defense game to start. It gets more difficult then in survive mode it becomes a useless game. Once the main storyline is completed which is very difficult for the last couple stages survival mode is a joke. Like even on the first learning level survival mode will kill you it‚Äôs impossible unless you dump money to continue the game wish they would make enemies a little less immortal so survival would be fun because now the game is not used and is worthless to me', 'Only played a few minutes, but played enough TD games to see that this one has a great campaign mode. Also, it doesn‚Äôt crash, has no other bugs so far, and no forced ads! Excellent for fans of the genre.', 'This game is fun with the exception of the improvisers limit. If you like to like to try out different strategies and are restarting the level multiple times you‚Äôll run out of improvisers and have to wait before playing again. You can, of course, spend game currency to buy more but then you won‚Äôt have that currency to upgrade towers. This is a stupid design if you want people to keep playing the game.']"

1065786902,"['This game is exceedingly fun and a unique (to me) experience. It uses a simple concept and goes places with it, instead of trying to make some over-complicated attempt at a puzzle game that‚Äôs far too common. However! A major downside to the game is that there are a few levels throughout that are not just challenging or difficult (which otherwise would be welcome) but become literally impossible, particularly trying for 3 stars. Not one person at the company thought it a good idea to play-test after updates affecting the gameplay? Bad move.I do suggest downloading this game and playing it for how fun and unexpectedly addicting it becomes. However beware of ads. While I understand the need and the cost of any game, it would be nice if we could just watch two or three ads at once in exchange for a longer tome without them. AKA not getting ‚Äòad attacked‚Äô once for pushing pause/menu and then immediately again after making a selection, sometimes glitching at that.

There is only one thing I want to address: I am not exactly sure why, but multiplayer and achievements buttons don‚Äôt work. I have tried restarting the app, my entire phone, but it doesn‚Äôt work.

A good game is a good game.', 'I would rate 5 stars easily if it wasn‚Äôt for this one issue but regardless of the issue, a recommended download:Unfortunately it seems multiplayer doesn‚Äôt work on all phones, attempted to connect via text message with a friend in the same room and nothing pulls up on his, nor does the multiplayer button even work on the title screen.With that said the game is pretty darn good, some of the opponents I‚Äôve still been unable to clear stages with 3 stars. Maybe 5-7 stages are like this. Once all the campaign is done I do enjoy the random matches immensely, sometimes easy, many times I get crushed, but it helps me problem solve and focus so I enjoy it.  One thing I would really enjoy trying is multiplayer, however it seems to be broken at the moment.  Great game overall!Don‚Äôt worry if it is frustrating sometimes, just think outside the box.', ""Pre-update: this was one of the most incredible strategy games on the market for the price, and even if it was a bit short, the random levels made up for that.

In addition to that, you now have to rate to unlock the random levels.Well, you guys wanted a rating and a review, now you've got one and one less customer.

Biggest recommendations for game is I‚Äôd update would start with Troops, they‚Äôve been left behind in progression and need more levels and abilities to be relevant to gameplay. Update spells level and types, if you can make a hero or more a month you can make a spell here and there. Garrisons, look I‚Äôve maxed min, I want larger max capacity level abilities and more towers. As of now there‚Äôs three types of towers, 5 in all. Make two more and add some walls. I have too many hero‚Äôs and nowhere to put them. Add wall garrison as well to increase defense or add totem ability and blasters or something into walls for offense. Mini towers, not a brief ability but a raid long ability. I get the skins purpose but need something to upgrade in camp. Don‚Äôt over do it like clash of clans but just enough to put some work in, I always have 3 on standby and two one awards. Lastly green and blue hero‚Äôs. Make more, allow them evolution. A evolved purple is still purple. Level the playing field. I want to evolve blue and green into a super blue or green, completely different hero and extended main abilities maintaining color properties but can fight toe to toe with purple evolution in battle.', 'I‚Äôve been playing this game for around 3 years now and here‚Äôs what I noticed.   A lot of reviews claim that this is a pay to win game.  I disagree.  Yes this game has constant deals and sales but they are not necessary to win.  There are very few hero‚Äôs that are only obtainable by buying them but unless your in the top one percent you won‚Äôt be facing these very unbalanced hero‚Äôs.  A big factor in this game is luck.  You can have crappy hero‚Äôs and be facing challenging opponents, but this can all change with luck.  I got my first very good hero from a daily hero collect.  This flipped the game for me.  Getting a single stroke of good luck will make your experience so much better.  With more recent updates igg has made it easy for new players to obtain large amounts of good hero‚Äôs and items that it is easy to not find yourself bored playing the game.   Another note about it not being a pay to win game is that a few months ago I dropped 100$ in the game I received as a gift.  Yes it made it easier to get good hero‚Äôs and progress  but even now my best hero‚Äôs I got from saving up and playing the game.

If you are really competitive and want to be a top player, luck is almost certainly not enough, you will need to spend a lot to buy the extra resources. But you can do quite well for very little. But someone has to pay for the servers and coders, there are no interrupting ads, so I don‚Äôt know why people complain about this. You need to decide how to invest in your heroes and troops and bases to succeed in a variety of subgames that test you in different ways, and more generally how much of your time and money you want to spend. There are now lots of side games, and you can spend hours a day doing them. One annoying feature is that some of the side games or freebies became available after several hours, so if you are trying to improve using time instead of money, you need to game several times a day. It will be a few hours a day if you want to do all the subgames.', 'It‚Äôs a fun game to play and I‚Äôve played it for 4plus years now. The reason I didn‚Äôt give it five stars is because the chat needs to be censored, it gets really bad. And igg has censor capabilities as they use them in their other game. And they have become more of a pay to play game than they used to be. I haven‚Äôt rolled one of the new heroes in a long long time. It used to be exciting to save up gems or buy one of the packs of gems, but it‚Äôs been impossible to roll anything new, so your better off waiting for a new hero to become $10. I preferred to be able to roll one as it was more exciting, but since I quit sinking money into the game I can not roll anything. I have a friend that has never spent money on the game in the last four years and he rolls better heroes. So apparently you either have to spend money continuously or don‚Äôt spend any at all.

Never played coc so I can‚Äôt say. You can get really far in this game and get the really good heroes without paying anything. It just takes some time and luck. I don‚Äôt know if I would ever pay money on this game, but there are ways around it. They are making it easier to get good heroes also. One thing I dislike is that I‚Äôm at a point where I can‚Äôt regularly spend excess gold and mana bc my walls are all maxed out, my builders are always busy, I can‚Äôt inscribe any more bc not enough crystals, etc. I really wish there was more you could do/build with the mana cost instead of the gold cost.

Also there is packs of resources that come out where you can buy them with GEMS not IRL money. Lastly in other reviews many people say their hero‚Äôs become obsolete or outdated after a few updates. That also is not true. The hero Pumpkin Duke one of my very first legends can still EASILY kill the newer hero‚Äôs with a good build. The people who say the stats don‚Äôt make sense are wrong. Every time your might increases a Valentina figure will EXPLAIN how the stats work and most of the people who said the stats are confusing mostly skipped over it. The ONE and ONLY complaint is that troops need a massive buff. The game has just evolved into ‚ÄúIf you have good hero‚Äôs that‚Äôs all you need‚Äù IGG needs to buff troops so they are actually effective in battle.', 'I find this game very fun to play, anytime I need something to kill some time I just hope on this game. Only thing I would have to complain about this game is the fact that when I first started playing you could get basically anything from rolling heros with gems, now you have to pay like $40 to get the new better heros. I have played this game for 4 years on several accounts but I can say that my free to play account has gathered better heros than my payed account. So if you start playing this Amazing game and plan on paying for the game then you have to buy packs every now and then if you want to continue to get good stuff. But if you plan on being a ftp person then do not spend any money at all or it will just make your time on that game a waste. But other than that this game is so stinking cool I hope on it everyday.

959428821,"['I‚Äôve been playing this game since the month it came out. I‚Äôve seen how the game has evolved over time, and I‚Äôve seen how the have made the games progression easier. Before the newest update this week, the game was becoming very bloated with how much you had to do if you were a new player. With there newest update, they gave every new and old account every character, and upgraded them to the second highest rank. I have to say this was a great way of making the game easier on both new and old players. Coming back to how this game can be confusing for any new player coming to the game, is just the amount of stuff they throw at your face when you open up the game. When you first start out, they try forcing you into the story when there are multiple things on your screen. An idea I have for the game to be easier on the new player would be to have a short tutorial going over every feature the game before they bring you to the story. Overall if you figure out what you have to do daily, then you will start to have fun with the game, just don‚Äôt burn yourself out on the game, it‚Äôs a game meant for 15 min of play a day', ""Hello focusdug, thank you for the great review. You definitely know the game very well and we are glad to hear that you've been enjoying it. We'll keep trying to make more contents and the game much more fun! "", 'This game was a LOT more difficult in the very beginning. You had to do a lot more and grind a lot more to get better characters. I just didn‚Äôt have the time to do everything, and so I deleted it off of my phone. Jump forward a bit later, and I decided to try it again. It got much easier. You are able to get rubies as long as you log in, you are able to get good characters quickly either through the log in or just grinding for bit(for example when I redownloaded it and they‚Äôd just come out with more characters I got seven in a week). The story is interesting enough, and all the extra fun stuff they‚Äôve added over time are great. I loved that it became easier, and more enjoyable. It‚Äôs a generous game, while still being a bit difficult. If I had to nitpick about anything in the game, its gotta be how just how they separate players when it comes to events, and by the I mean the absolute lack of separation based on levels. When you join the arena for example it‚Äôs unlikely that you‚Äôll find someone weaker than you in the selections because every single person is put in the same group. There isn‚Äôt any separation based on levels. This makes the arena extremely difficult to enjoy, especially for newer players. Other than this though, I truly do love this game, and it‚Äôs very fun.', ""What once was arguably one of the best side-scrolling rpgs is now one of the worst. I will never forget my first days playing this game when it first came out. It had just the right amount of difficulty where losing only motivated you more. Every time a boss killed you, you would just feel that more gratified once you beat it. The style and design of this game was unspeakably the best. There was a storyline, there was action, there was just the right amount of farming, equipment played SUCH a huge role, where even one singular item would make all the difference. Growth in-game felt real and you got to see just how strong you characters became and it was distinct and raw and authentic. The introduction of the brave busters was an incredible addition that made you feel just that more powerful once you obtained one. But now, there is no distinguishing between strong or weak, all visuals are overused and overwhelming, you have access to an insane amount of characters where it's impossible to know which one to focus on to use. This game had some of the most incredible potential in its first year or two. But now? It feels nothing like it was, as if the game I played was a completely different one. I miss that feeling of being weak but truly working for your strength and seeing that through and through. Please, bring back the spark you used to have."", 'I‚Äôve been playing since the beginning when they had only the first chapter, and it‚Äôs so hard to keep up with everything and everyone. There is such a difference in power between people. I was a dedicated player, and hey, maybe I‚Äôm not the best. I get that. But the difference in power with other players is just way too much. Also, when you finally get stable footing in the game, they have an update that changes the whole game. Sure enough, everyone already has the max level, best gear, and the best heroes that didn‚Äôt even exist seconds before. I‚Äôve tried all of the leveling tips and tricks, and it just doesn‚Äôt seem like you can get anywhere unless you play the game 24/7 or have immense amounts of money. Not to mention the story, it‚Äôs so useless and it just doesn‚Äôt make sense anymore. Every character evolves in every other update, and it‚Äôs very frustrating. You need to do a scavenger hunt every time they add more heroes unless you want your formerly OP character to get demolished. I spent so much effort to get up to speed with everyone else, but it always ends up with me wasting my time on a character that isn‚Äôt as good as the one they just pulled outta nowhere. Not only that, but I recently got one of my friends to play, and they just gave a brand new player a whole set of good characters that are fully enhanced! It takes me MONTHS to get in that position, yet they get it all by playing a tutorial. GREAT.', 'So why am I giving it four? Something so silly, in fact, that I have no actual idea why they don‚Äôt fix it: The hiding of gifts behind seasonal blind boxes. Last month it was Fairy Horesh Gifts, and this month it‚Äôs Easter Eggs. Why am I having a tantrum worth a whole star, you might well ask. After all, these gifts‚Äîthree of them a day!!‚Äîare free! Free is better than nothing, right? Maybe, depending on how you look at it. Right now, my inventory of shoes and raid tickets is full. One of those items is a potential drop from these Easter Eggs, and until I make enough room, I can‚Äôt open ANY Easter Eggs. This wouldn‚Äôt be a(s much of a) problem if the game would tell me how many of either of these I need to use up in order to make enough room. But considering that sometimes the game will drop 600 shoes or tickets at a time, I‚Äôm more willing to play almost not at all than I am willing to use up that many fuel items with no promise that even that will be enough. Either make these blind boxes a little less blind in the ways I‚Äôve outlined above, or keep the dent in my score for this game.EDIT: Almost nine months later, I‚Äôm lopping off another star because I can‚Äôt do Daily Challenges if the game never connects to the server for the World Boss.

A few years later, I return and the game is desperately throwing free stuff to help F2P players at least survive in the competitive ring. The people that pay, however, will always end up at the top, it‚Äôs undeniable. There is truly an issue when the game itself has to massively compensate players to help them SURVIVE in the PvP aspect of the game. While it does keep players around, the game has become so diluted. The story keeps getting more generic, and one can pass through a brand new chapter in around 20 minutes. I‚Äôm still sticking around with a glimmer of hope, but the cycle needs to be broken. Quests and ‚ÄúEvents‚Äù are just grinding and nothing particularly does anything until the massive updates with new tiers of heroes that keep making everybody more and more OP. Then it stalemates again. I‚Äôm considering retiring again, because if you love it let it go and it will come back if it loves you too. TLDR:Game will let you play and have fun as F2P, but the grind will become lackluster and don‚Äôt even dream of getting to the top if you‚Äôre not maxing out your card.', 'I‚Äôm editing this (again, agin), and I just need to say, I love this.

The Adventure Dungeon. It‚Äôs just kinda frustrating that I have to redo the whole entire story. I just wanna go to the last part I was in before.

I eventually quit after needing too many resources and characters (keys, titans, souls, etc) to keep up.The game is constantly changing.  I understand that trying to keep it fresh is ideal, but I feel like whatever the company is doing is just not working.  It doesn‚Äôt feel like a fun game anymore.  Just my opinion.  They would‚Äôve been better off keeping it as it was and just making a Dragon Blaze 2 or even something with a completely different title, since it doesn‚Äôt even feel like the same game.

I used to be able to play it for hours on end just grinding until I ran out of shoes or tickets. But, after a while it just becomes the same thing over and over again. The fighting is so tedious and there‚Äôs no way to skip it, so you just have to sit there and watch your allies fight the same boss for ten minutes straight not even being able to go out of the app. I wish that the fighting and adventure styles were more fun, like actually giving the player something to do or giving the player a skip button knowing that it‚Äôs tedious to watch their allies fight for ten or even fifteen minutes straight just to kill off the boss. You can‚Äôt even really target enemies anymore, which used to be the only way to actually help the fight go quicker. However that would only help it go quicker in the case of pvp.']"

898383017,"['I‚Äôve loved this game for years but I haven‚Äôt been compelled to type a review until now. Everything is great. I love having a base and having fleets. It‚Äôs hard to get certain weapons and blueprints, but that‚Äôs what makes getting them feel so good to the player. It‚Äôs perfectly set up and everything is wonderful in this explosive universe. There is just one thing that I find extremely frustrating though, and that‚Äôs repair time. Attacking with fleets is the main and most exciting part of the game. It‚Äôs where we, the players, actually get to play the game and use our minds to command. Currently there‚Äôs a very exciting event going on that offers blueprints that I could really use right now. However, my fleets are all destroyed and it takes half a day to repair each one. If I could change one thing about the game I would reduce repair time. It really holds everyone back, and since we pay He3 and AM to repair it just makes it more difficult to recover. Please reconsider repair times. This is a great game. Let us play it more.', 'The game overall is really well put together but is rather poorly balanced in several aspects. The game can be very entertaining but the progression is extremely slow and the only way to progress in a substantial way without sinking years into the game is through the overpriced currency. In order to get ahead you have to constantly be upgrading your ships and your base witch is normally good if it didn‚Äôt take days to do and use a massive amount of resources to upgrade a single building. This is negated entirely by buying the currency because it can both massively speed up the process to a pace that is completely unmatched by grind. (Ex it takes around 20 battles to get about a quarter full resources or about 40 minutes of grind) fleet leveling is also very unbalanced as in a lv115 fleet will be decimated by a lv117. within seconds the 115 will be wiped out and the 117 will have taken no damage at all to spite the fact they are 2 lv apart.(keep in mind that you have to be within a certain margin of lv to attack a fleet) Tactics could play a huge role in this game if it weren‚Äôt for the fact that it‚Äôs very unbalanced. The events are fun but are inaccessible to newer players and are prime places for higher level players to wait for someone to attack. I really do enjoy the game but I don‚Äôt have the time or the money to spend grinding to take a step in the right direction when someone could pay 25$ and jump into the next century.', 'Ok pointing out the obvious when you first start your adventure into playing this game it‚Äôs enjoyable and fun as it‚Äôs new, repairs are Short if not instant so with that being said you are lured in very easily. Now the reason for my 3 star review. I don‚Äôt like painting games but as I see it this game feels very much pay to win. If you buy coins or pre-fitted fleet from the store then your fun is only matched by how long your fleet last. For a person that buys coins your repair time is nothing and can just go back out to fight again. But for those that don‚Äôt buy coins then patience is a virtue you must have. Say you have a lvl 90 fleet and someone decides to attack you with a lvl 105 fleet and destroys you it can take a literal day to repair if you buy coins then it‚Äôs nothing but if you don‚Äôt then you just had fun for 5 minutes and now you have to wait hours before you can do it again. Not to mention that someone lvl 50 can have its way any time it wants if your lvl 20 and below because you don‚Äôt have anything to attack back. 3 stars because in all honesty waiting 24hrs for your fleet to repair its self for that 5 minute match just isn‚Äôt that fun.Can you have fun without coining, sure but understand that if you do not have patience then this game may not be for you.', 'The game is nice looking and lot of things to potentially do but it all gets ruined by 2 things. The wait times to repair your fleet are ridiculous and you can‚Äôt repair more than one ship at a time. PLEASE FIX THIS. If my fleet needs to get repaired, it can take up to 20 hours to complete it. And that is with the 90% shortened time bonus. Add that to the restriction of only one ship repair at a time and you are essentially asking the player to pay upwards of $5 to repair every time. That will absolutely make people stop playing.Also please allow people to quit a battle that is too much for them. I‚Äôve had times where I was trying to battle one ship, but I accidentally click another and lose because there are so many ships on the screen. Once that happens I have to wait 20 hours or pay cash and that‚Äôs just one battle.Summary: Great potential but you have deadly problems that can kill your game.', 'This is one of the things that absolutely needs a refresh. This game can honestly be extremely fun but, repair times kills the fun. And I know this has to be the games main money maker but, if repair times keep up like this people will not play and those who have the game won‚Äôt recommend it to others. The game has a time token system but when it comes to ships time tokens are M.I.A. at least you should revamp the repair times in the game or give tokens every now and then for killing fleets and why is there a time limit on when you can use tokens? They expire if you don‚Äôt use them forcing you to use coins that you actually have to pay real cash for. And for the love of god why can‚Äôt I upgrade an entire fleet at once, instead of a single ship at a time that you guessed it takes days to upgrade and refit. Time tokens need to be plentiful to keep the players you have and this alone will boost your player base and will allow for more recommendations to your game. Either from that this game is pretty good.', 'I am revisiting my old friend, VEGA Conflict, where the amount of time I could waste is extraordinary!!

And honestly it was my fault but I eventually ran out of resources and my mines being low level income source weren‚Äôt enough to even repair,upgrade, craft or do anything since my resource income was so low‚Ä¶ honestly hard reset this ENTIRE game remove some things and change things up and maybe I‚Äôd actually spend money on it because it‚Äôs a shame a real shame that a game with this much potential got screwed this HARD', 'I‚Äôve been playing this game for years, little more than half a decade, on and off. The one thing that continues to be wonderful is the support. Every now and then Vega Conflict gifts you ships or resources or time tokens because it‚Äôs either a holiday or they had some issues and it‚Äôs for reparations. These gifts are absolute godsends. I love the new Spectre ships coming out, there powerful and strong and once you get one of those ship it snowballs and in no time flat you have an entire fleet and it‚Äôll continue to grow. A lot of people complain on time, understandable, but they complain about costing money to play...be patient. This game isn‚Äôt about being the biggest or strongest, everything is relegated by level/tier. There‚Äôs nothing pressuring the user to purchase, other than the ‚ÄúI need it!‚Äù mentality. Lastly, Vega Conflict, y‚Äôall are great. With the news center, gifts, and support, the game feels personal like y‚Äôall care about the game. P.S. can y‚Äôall do a UI update for iPhone X, the buttons just need to be shoved to the corners of the screen, it‚Äôs not utilizing the entire screen space of the iPhone X.', 'They take your money you have fun for a little bit then they change the way things work and make all that money you spent and things you bought completely worthless and pointless. Will never ever again play this game. I learned my lesson with this developer. As per the devs response yes things most definitely change over time to the point is makes things you purchased worthless and the amount of time taken to rebuild after an attack even a win is so unreasonable it‚Äôs not even funny so nice try with that response. I don‚Äôt care about minor tweaks but what y‚Äôall did went beyond a slight change. You made things that use to be a quick repair take days and weeks and so forth. You ruined a good game and all of these so called changes only goal achieved was to make people spend more money if they wanted any actual length of game play as any attack you spend all time playing the repair game.', ""Thanks for playing Vega Conflict.

I‚Äôve seen some complaints from people that you gather game stuff and xp too slowly, or that you have to pay to win. I can comfortably play in the morning and evening without running out of energy and I‚Äôm not buying from the store. (Sorry, King) However, I did pony up for a $4.99 special because I‚Äôve honestly had a lot of enjoyment so far and look forward to more. I‚Äôm always surprised by people who are shocked at the concept of paying something for an app‚Äîdo they really think companies make them because they don‚Äôt plan to earn any money? Having a guild group that works together to whittle down a boss is nice, although it looks like we have no chance against the coiners in the leaderboards. I totally love the fact that the store will hang on to two treasure chests for you since I need to be at work during the day or getting some sleep, so 8 hours away is no big deal. (Thanks, King!)

Try it out!', 'I love this game, I really do.  The gameplay mechanics are fun, there‚Äôs a great creature variety that can be built up over time, lots of fun play modes, and a very engaged player community.  This could be really big over multiple years if Snowprint/King manage it well.Why one star?  They‚Äôre not managing it well, they‚Äôre doing the exact opposite.  There has been a long-standing ‚Äútest‚Äù that gives dramatically better gold rewards to some players and much worse rewards to others.  This is creating a toxic haves and have-nots culture in the game.  Great players who love the game but drew the wrong straw are quitting.  It is straight up poor management of a player base and not okay.  End the experiment and put everyone on a level playing field before you completely destroy the player base you‚Äôve built!* Updated Jan 28: all the feedback seems to have worked and with the latest update they‚Äôve put players all back onto the same equal footing, so upping the rating to 5 stars again', 'This is a very fun game that really draws you in at the start. At first it seems like there is good progression. And it is true that there are enough game modes that you can ‚Äúgrind‚Äù and level up your character. But alas it will happen - the inevitable paywall. Unfortunately it comes in a pretty frustrating way as things seem to go good until your turns no longer can come up with matches in any way shape or form as the computer. Yes I get it‚Äôs a game of chance but something gets really fishy when you can have the exact same characters as the computer (on arena mode for example) and somehow every turn they get matches on ALL their moves and you PERHAPS get one. It happens very consistently almost to the point that you have no choice but to spend to level up your characters or to unlock new ones to stand a chance. Even if the computer got matches half the time it would be more balanced but they seriously get the best random placement 90% of the time. There‚Äôs no way I should get obliterated over and over using the same characters at the same level as the computer. And the campaign eventually uses so much energy even if you win you can only play around 5 matches or so before having to wait for the extremely slow energy refill system. So again to play you‚Äôll have to pay. I really really liked this game and the numerous game mode options made me feel like I could patiently grind day by day but the playing field has officially become way to unbalanced.', 'If you are thorough, you can play this game every day and get amazing rewards over time. Join a guild and get more rewards . Between normal map missions that require the usual energy that recharges over time, and the ‚ÄúTitan‚Äù battles where you collectively chip away at a large enemy, there are many other things to do. It will infuriate you as any ‚Äúrandom‚Äù game will but it‚Äôs worth playing, and after you get to a high enough level, you‚Äôll have much to do and rewards to make your characters stronger. Great concept (that was my review BEFORE the new update)Update: 1 Star. This is officially the last time I will have have this game crash during a boss battle when I have dealt over 2000 damage only to log back in to discover no damage at all was recorded and my flags(attempt) was used up. This is unacceptable. This has been going on for almost 2 years now. It is affecting my guilds ranking and it‚Äôs just lazy. People have been complaining about this on the forums and in these reviews and you clearly have not given it the attention it deserves. Bottom line: you have FAILED to make your game more stable and fix the glitches and crashes that have been an ONGOING issue and instead chose to revamp the system and turn the currency upside down, making several key crafting items unavailable without paying money. Disgraceful. I will be uninstalling this game and recommending EVERYONE I know to stay away from it.', 'I will start by saying that the game I‚Äôm it‚Äôs basic design is fun and has a nice story. I will also start by saying, to be clear, this review is NOT an issue between those who pay and those who don‚Äôt.Unfortunately, I would recommend everyone to stay away and not download the game. King has engaged in what could be determined as borderline illegal business practice by making the game completely unfair between people doing the exact same thing at equal levels: some are getting massive amounts of gold while others in equal circumstances are getting pittance, and it‚Äôs not just a random chance chest thing - there are two tiers of gold payout for the player base, basically those in a poverty tier and those in a wealthy tier, and those tiers are (apparently) randomly assigned. Meanwhile they‚Äôve hiked up all the gold prices in the game so those who are not in the wealthy tier are unable to acquire goods to advance at a pace even remotely close to those who are.I really did like the game, but I refuse to play a game where it is completely unfair between equal circumstance players. To be clear, this is NOT an issue between those who pay and those who don‚Äôt. Shame on you, King, for this kind of treatment to your players, especially when you had a really good game design! üò†', 'It‚Äôs so weird to say this about a casual mobile game, but this game changed my life. I‚Äôve been playing it every day for almost three years. The guild battle (dungeon) mode led me eventually to a Discord community (Reddit United) of friends I talk to daily. They‚Äôre all over the world and I know many of them better than my own coworkers and family. I also joined the Facebook group which is run by a brilliant and hilarious community manager. And that, in turn, led me to become part of the beta testing group for the past two years. I‚Äôve worked in game development for 11 years. Through the transparency, patience and generosity of the Snowprint devs I have learned more about game design through this beta testing group than I ever have in school or as an actual game developer. They have a deep desire to make the game their players want, and spend many hours every week engaging with us beta testers as player advocates. For my part I don‚Äôt have much to ask them for. I love the game. It gives me a mental bubble to think and problem solve. That helps me in both work and personal situations. And I cannot remember life without the tight knit group of friends I‚Äôve made in my beta testing group and in my Discord server. It‚Äôs great to have a community of like minded people to discuss interesting topics with day or night. This game gives so much more than it takes.', 'I loved this game the first two days. I invested a decent amount of cash because it seemed I would get a lot of play time out of it. Everything was progressing at a hood pace and I felt my time and money investment were worthwhile. On day three everything changed dramatically. First, you only have enough energy to attempt 4 campaign levels at a time. Second, the events become exponentially more difficult requiring you to either spend (more) real money or fail at the same junk for days on end. Third, and the worst, the wording they use in purchases are intentionally deceiving. A ‚Äúgood‚Äù chance at a legendary is around 7% and a ‚Äúgreat‚Äù chance at a legendary character is a whopping 16%. These stats can only be found by tapping a very small ? Icon in the corner. Those are not ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúgreat‚Äù odds considering they cost the equivalent of $20-$40. In addition, the most recent event is worded ‚Äútrade pumpkins for foulsprite gems‚Äù leading you to believe it is guaranteed. After spending real money on pumpkins I did not receive any gems and found out there is only a 50% chance to get them. The wording should say ‚Äútrade pumpkins for a CHANCE of foulsprite gems‚Äù. In sum, do not waste your time or money. The developer is deceitful and not worthy of your hard earned cash.', 'So I already got recommended to not play the game but I want to see what it was like soooo I kind a have to download this game. And boy oh boy was it not worth my time it really takes you 1 million moons to be able to rank up a character nowadays well if you have the money anyway. I tried this game every day and night for nothing not only because the players at first give you no status. But I almost had a heart attack because I thought that I was not going to defeat the first boss on the first chapter. Looking back at this game now I‚Äôm surprised I even downloaded it literally I spent most of my time just trying to get through the first boss. But we aren‚Äôt even done the hand movements that they want you to do to get a pacific thing are kind of annoying I wish that we could get more moves because you literally are not getting nothing and you have to continue summoning more monsters until you hit two moves to just get that one character.

For now I feel locked in and forced to advance through the game although I really don‚Äôt understand how the game works. I get it, I make combos. What I really don‚Äôt see is the enemy moves. Sometimes they attack, sometimes they don‚Äôt. Sometimes I get hit, sometimes I don‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt really understand how any move I make can really combat the enemy or influence any moves they make. Kinda feel like I‚Äôm playing a slot machine where it doesn‚Äôt really matter, just watching what the results will be. I want to know o beat the round, that my intelligence beat the level. Wish I had more rows and columns of my characters and have more characters on the field. Feels too small. Feels too cramped. Feels like not much of a challenge and worse, at the end of a level, the prizes are so minimal. The prizes should be dependent of how well one plays a level. If we make excellent combos and win in the fewest amount of moves, then we should receive much more coins and stones... much much more. I really want to like this game. Wish I could pick the avatar. Wish I could decide the name, the gender, the look... would be awesome to get an LGBT option. As I win levels, would love to win customization options for my avatar. Really, really want to like this game. Hope there are improvements to come. Version 2.0?', 'This is an awesome concept! However it gets difficult quickly requiring you to upgrade your guys. In order to get gold you have to play your campaign (best way to get gold) still not a deal breaker again. Then you upgrade your troops with character gems and gold. This is where you have problems. After you get the gold from the campaign levels you can‚Äôt go back and get more gold from them. This means you rely on the gold you gain from the campaign. Once the campaign gets to rough and your about to throw your phone you realize you need to buy a character to really move on. I know you can get gold from fighting in arena but it‚Äôs not much. And again you need to upgrade your characters to keep winning arena battles. These also get harder quick. They also have guild boss battles that your team has to destroy..... yeah you get a few guild coins but it helps a little Not much.The Fix? Make it that you can go back and get gold from previously beaten levels. Maybe not as much as the first time. I‚Äôm going to keep playing for a few weeks if nothing changes then I‚Äôm gone.']"

There are several events that come and go and give good rewards. The graphics are are decent for a mobile game and there‚Äôs a lot of content to play through. As you progress in levels it gets very difficult to do anything without making purchases, which I do understand that the game needs to make money, but that puts the players who cannot spend $20-$50+ often at the very bottom. Also, there are many high level players that will CONSISTENTLY bully others with no hesitation. The bullying may vary from kingdom to kingdom, but don‚Äôt be surprised if you see yourself or a player being bullied. As several other players have said, it is a very unwelcoming community, but there are some decent players that will make the game a little bit more tolerable. Another issue with this game is the attention you need to give it throughout your day. Higher level players will most likely reset what other players have worked very hard for or purchased, in this case it would be resources (food, wood, etc.), and without being  attentive, the player cannot know when someone is about to attack their keep, which in the end means that the average person who works and has a busy schedule will not succeed in this game by any means.

425160860,"['Like many players of a certain age, I come looking for something that recaptured the vintage Strategic Conquest, and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. If the makers of this game are looking for ideas on how to make it even better, here‚Äôs two: 1) the old Strategic Conquest allowed you to ‚Äúprogram‚Äù where the output of a city would move - in other words, all the planes or ships made by a given city would automatically head for the front when they were built. This saved a lot of tedium on large maps in the later stages.2) one of the most satisfying features of the original Civ I was the replay at the end - the small world map with the colored areas showing all the civs would play an accelerated recap of how each power had risen and fallen throughout the game. This would make winning even more fun as you watched how you‚Äôd grown from a minuscule power to a world-dominating force.', 'I LOVE playing this game, and will continue to be addicted to it, but I agree that there are a few features from Strategic conquest, that would be great for this. Definitely bring back the city production list, as that only seems realistic that any warring power would want to take inventory and scheduling on what they‚Äôre producing. Also the old game used to have a feature where, before you sent a plane flying or ship on a certain course, you could drag the cursor to a place in the map to see how many sections you‚Äôd be traveling, or you could also set a ship sailing all the way across the world if you dragged that far.  Also, as morbid as it sounds, I think you should bring back the future of being able to attack your own vehicles, as sometimes you need to clear something out of the way to attack an opponent .', ""The game has many maps, and the addition of the option to end the game when conquering a certain portion of the map is also convenient. It might be an interesting idea to add maps which are almost all land, to enphasize ground type warfare. Perhaps one of those maps could also have a single small river with a few bases along it's route to emphasize geound warfare, but offer a strategic opportunity to supplement an assault with ships and resources. Oh, maybe another option where there's a chance the difficulty could get even harder (or their resources build twice as fast), and different colored teams merge together against the main player as they conquer more of the map. Maybe that could be a randomly generated thing. Still, a fun, addicting game."", 'This game is, er was about an 80% clone of the old Empire, War Game of the Century.

Changing the game control locations was a bit confusing but I can adapt. Changing the way the game plays, specifically the fighters, absolutely NERFS out your fighters.

I did all-nighters playing the game in 1989 and suffered the next day at work.My only quibble is that there's no auto-forwarding of units, so it can be a little tedius moving every piece near the end of the game when you have a lot of them.

First, they give you the monkeys (towers) after every run, why?  why not let you play for a while with one tower to learn since they have so many before they introduce another one or an upgrade.  and why do you need so many different towers, it‚Äôs ridiculous.  They introduce towers and upgrades at such a fast rate it‚Äôs hard to really understand in a timely manner.also, the balloons come at such a fast rate, and there are so many, it just gets monotonous, not saying that it‚Äôs in possible or that it‚Äôs not even easy, it just seems ridiculous to have so many balloons swapping you at once; what‚Äôs the point?and then finally, maybe it‚Äôs me, but I cannot find a pause button.  you let me set up my monkeys at the start of the game, so why can I hit the pause button and figure out where I want to land one in the middle of a battle, like field runners.  Maybe you do allow it and it‚Äôs just not intuitive.Again, FieldRunners original 10 years, monkeys and balloons 2 days... still trying to figure out why everybody is giving this five stars...somewhat entertaining but certainly not grwat......enough said...', 'I try to do it but it just won‚Äôt work so I‚Äôve my suggestion is that you associate the Facebook account with my progress because apparently I can log in with two devices with my account at the exact same time and it doesn‚Äôt matter so can you please fix this and associate my profile with my progress so he can make it 10 times easier and I tried transferring my progress that I have in my phone onto my tablet but it will just won‚Äôt work so please fix this.

The maze maker won‚Äôt damage bloons itself, so it makes sense only with other towers.)Eighth, for round 115, add Dark Derigible Titans (just like you did on Bloons Monkey City).Ninth, add Camo MOABs at round 100, Camo BFBs at round 135, and Camo ZOMGs at round 165.Tenth,add flying bloons that go from one side of the screen to another.

The maps change, but the bloons are always the same. The levels are so long (40-85 waves!) that you don‚Äôt have incentive to try different strategies, cause if you lose you‚Äôve got to replay 84 levels again. So you stick with the mechanic because nothing else is as reliable, and spend most of the time watching nothing happen because it works best right next to the entrance. The random missions are the best part of the game because they offer variety. Also of note: two of the maps shown in the screenshots are not actually in the game.', 'This is such an awesome game and definitely worth the money! I was thinking for the specialist buildings, you should make Monkey Village and Banana Farm specialist buildings! Even if one upgrade just reduces the cost of the tower by 5% like the rest of the specialist building upgrades have, that would definitely be fine. Banana Farms and Monkey Villages are pretty expensive in-game, and I thought it‚Äôd be pretty awesome to have a specialist building for each, to make those less expensive at least. :) I really enjoy playing this game!

The graphics are old school--you have to be ready for some small detail, some reading, the occasional mis-click when a button is too small. No matter--this is the trade-off for a rich, strategic game instead of a cartoony slash fest. So worth it to have a game that is not dumbed down.

The music is good, great levels of play starting off on each island at an easy level then slowly advancing throughout the game. I definitely could do without the animated skit so I just skipped all that. I‚Äôm going to wait for a bit then start from the beginning again. I achieved all the treasures and 3 flags on at least 40 levels to get the Mastery completion.  It was really nice not having to pay money for every little thing as required in most games. No gold, diamonds or cash really needed for anything. That is a first! Lol.  Most games want you to spend money on every 3-5 levels but this game never called for that.

If you click on a task when a worker is busy, you're stuck waiting. I'd like to be able to click my moves in advance. All things considered, it's a great game.

Always buy bowlers, never buy batsmen because you have to bat yourself and it doesn‚Äôt matter what level your batsmen are. Always bowl first so that u know the target u are chasing.

It has some great shots, customization is very enjoyable as well plus you get the chance to play alongside star players from around the world and also sign them.

I already spend $60 dollars on this game and I am in Division 2 right now.

The top tier (level 1) is unplayable, the computer is impossible to beat.

Good luck with that unless you want to give these crooks a lot of $$ for at least having a chance against the computer.

But if you move up the levels (specifically level 10) the semifinals are leveled up in difficulty compared to difficulty level for the same team in the league stage. I initially thought of it as a random event but it happened again and again. Seems like the developers moved the difficulty up for the key games in the same level and even if you have beaten the team in the group stages, you cannot beat them in the semifinals or final.

I don‚Äôt know if this is a glitch or something but if you have purposely made the game so that it would slowly begin to stop hits to ‚Äúbalance‚Äù the game.

But after tackling those, the ones simply marked ‚Äúhard‚Äù seem much easier. I‚Äôve only encountered two trivial bugs in all these years, and tech support has been responsive and helpful.

The animations are decent, and the gameplay is both tactical and challenging. The best thing about this game is that it is free, and not pay to win. The online extra features are totally optional, and the game never forces you to buy them. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of classic tabletop RPG‚Äôs to play this game immediately!!!', 'I love that Pravato included the Dice rolls on this. You can turn them off if you want, but I LOVE THEM. I loved them on Arcane Quest 2. The dice rolls help this to feel like an old school board game rpg, which is what keeps me coming back. It kills me that other developers don‚Äôt have 1/5 of the good taste of Marc Pravato. Warhammer Quest on ios plays so sluggishly and lacks dice display. Arcane Quest 3 is much snappier, has better options, and has custom quests, inexpensive 1 time IAP. This is a thing of beauty. Pravato for life!', 'I have been looking for a game on my phone that plays like D&D. For the most part this game fills that need. Easy to figure out, an appropriate level of difficulty and flexibility, I like that you can control each character so I can make the spells and abilities work with each other. It is well worth it to spend the little money for the full version. A+ game in my book.', 'A step up from the already fun arcane quest 2.  Not an ‚Äúautomatic‚Äù game like so many out there where you are essentially pressing the ‚Äúnext‚Äù button over and over, this requires thought and strategy.  And it looks pretty!  It would be extra awesome if the character picture and tabletop view of the character all changed and matched with equipment, but still great without that.']"
958763157,"['The game used to be more fun and balanced.  Lately it‚Äôs been more of a money-grab. It has decreased the amount of awards from events and gotten out of balance unless you have deep pockets. The ‚Äúpacks‚Äù have little value and aren‚Äôt worth the amount of money they‚Äôre asking. Mythic dragons are unattainable now unless you spend at least half your day with continuous playing or most of your paycheck. Sigil prizes during events are so spread out now that it‚Äôs just lost its luster.  2 years ago I could obtain a mythic with far less money... now it‚Äôs next to impossible unless, like I said, you spend spend spend. The feeding event was one of my favorite events but I imagine they weren‚Äôt making enough money with it. They took it away and replaced it with more money grabbing pvp. The game itself is still fun and I continue to play. But I don‚Äôt spend much more money other than the elite and atlas elite.  Customer service is excellent if you have a problem. The game is addicting, the dragons are well designed and fierce looking. Overall, it‚Äôs one of the best games out there if you love dragons! I just hope they make it more balanced and mythic dragons available to everyone like a cpl years ago instead of obtaining a ridiculous amount of keys to ‚Äúunlock‚Äù a digital product that is by no means ‚Äúscarce‚Äù...', 'When I started this game I thought it was pretty awsome the first few dragons are pretty cool but as you get a higher level it gets intense and amazing. This team I am on is great I‚Äôve been through a few tryed to start one too. If you want to start a team be patient it takes awhile to get players. But over all this game was awsome if you like dragons you may like this game if you like strategy games then this can be good for you I recommend to find a player that knows a lot about the game it really helps out a lot that‚Äôs what happened to me so try to find a trusting player. If you get this game make sure you have a good amount of space it dose take a lot up why you get higher, but over all the game is great it can be a good game if you like talking or texting whatever you call it. This game I give it a five because I‚Äôve met good ‚Äúfriends‚Äù it‚Äôs a lot of fun. If the events get confusing you can always ask higher players about it. About the events they get you different dragons that are really good. Two of my favorite events is the breeding because if you save up the breeding tokens till the event you get a lot of points I also like the building event you upgrade your towers to get points. Over all if you are thinking about getting this game and are not sure, you should get it this game is sooo fun! Also if you ever want to try and find me in the game my name is MysticHeroKing so take a look at my profile if you want but just enjoy the game!', 'I absolutely love this game. I‚Äôve been playing for about 5 months now and I absolutely love the team I‚Äôm on. Took me a few team changes to get to where I wanted to be but I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm where I am.This is a competitive game and can be very time consuming but also can work around a busy schedule if you care enough to work with it. You don‚Äôt have to spend money unless you want to but I will say it helps to have an Elite account, especially if you want to really progress in the game. If I had anything else to say, it wouldn‚Äôt be particularly criticism, but a piece of advice/inspiration for the creators. It would be simply this: many that play for long periods of time work really hard to progress in the game and once they get somewhere successful, often times the smallest thing holds them back from helping their team really win in the end. I would love it, and I know many others would too, if the creators made a chest that could be won by achieving some goal once a month that would give a healthy dose of Sigil, Rubies, Egg Tokens, 12 hour speed ups and maybe even some lumber and food. Rubies are hard to get unless yourself or teammates buy packages often. Sigil only comes around when you really spend a ton of time in events. So if a prize like that could be won and earned, available to anyone without purchasing anything, that would be so awesome. But besides all that, this game is addictive and fun! 5 Stars!', 'ints on & downloading this game/app was a big point gainer! Seemed easy & I thought, ‚Äúwhy not‚Äù... Well 61 levels later I have easily made more online friends & invested much more online time in this game than any other game to date! It is pretty repetitive at first, but there is so much more to the game when you decide to start taking it more serious! If you are looking for a game that takes little skill, tons of strategy, & a game that is very diversified with girls, women, boys & men, this is the best game for you! Just be aware of just how addicting it can get. I have spent easily over $100 dollars in the last 6 months & that isn‚Äôt even close to what some of the people end up spending in this game! I never spend money on apps but this one got me! That is one negative I‚Äôd say about this game, but that is also a choice you have! You definitely do NOT have to spend money on this game if you don‚Äôt want... I recommend this game highly! Best non-sports games I‚Äôve ever played! Try it people! I can almost guarantee that you are going to end up falling in love like I did! P.S.- If you do fall in love with this game the way I did, & really want to join a group of nice people that take it serious, but not to serious, ask to join ‚ÄúGarden of Bones‚Äù! We are always recruiting & would love to have you if you want to advance as a unit & are willing to play every day! Anyways, good luck & thanks for reading!', 'The first thing to mention about this game is that it is a little tough to get into. It isn‚Äôt well-explained beyond basic mechanics, so, at a glance, it seems like there isn‚Äôt much to it. Unfortunately, this turns some people off to it before they have a chance to realize the depth of the game. Everything progression-related is interlinked. Player level, dragon level, base tower levels, etc. all contribute toward what a player is capable of within the game, forcing players to keep some form of balance. This can be achieved without dumping money into the game‚Äîthe best dollars spent for progression are on an Elite account. The only reason I can‚Äôt give the game 5 Stars is because it has some irritating bugs that aren‚Äôt addressed as regularly as they should be, and the Atlas expansion (second half of the game which gives a serious long-term advantage to those who have it) is only available to a smaller percentage of the player base. This does not affect the average player‚Äôs experience, but it becomes an issue for anyone who decides they want WD to be their go-to mobile game (over a host of other options on the market). Fun game, especially when you find a good team. Logical progression, especially once you get the hang of things. Good staying power with regular seasons and weekly events. Would recommend.', 'I‚Äôve been playing this game for a total of three years and I love it, the developers fix bugs when spotted, add new content fairly often, and the teams in this game are almost required just because rewards are higher with a team. Teams do wars and battles together all the time, and if your just starting out you can freeload your way to the top ranks. And this is what I love so much about the game.        There is one thing I could change about this game, and if you read the title of this review you know what I am talking about. The Events. The events get to be a great thing and the prize get better and better the more you play. In the summer of 2017 I participated in my first event. The prizes are top tier prizes, but since the developers keep on adding new tiers of dragons eggs, the other dragons from the olden day events fall back a ton. So since the original event dragons are bad now they need to add MORE event dragons to keep up with the new tiers of eggs, but this isn‚Äôt a terrible thing because it‚Äôs new content, but it‚Äôs kind of bad because I have NEVER seen the same event dragon appear twice in different events, so all I ask is for the developers to release the same dragons at least once more and improve them by adding extra tier orbs to Evolve those older dragons to the top tier of egg for more variety to your dragon builds.', 'Hey! I‚Äôve got some ideas for the game. New towers: catapult tower, mini Gun tower, rocket tower, lava tower, elemental tower, and the diamond tower. New dragon class: emperor, super dragons with super abilities, instead of firing fire balls, it shoots 4 powerful shots, enough to wipe out the entire enemy base. New mode: battle mode, you control your dragon and fight other dragons to the death. You see, I‚Äôve gotten the game in 2017 and ever since then, I loved the game. Here are some problems, I wish there were more modes and add a battle mode where you control your dragon and fight other dragons to the death. What I really hate about this game is that when you don‚Äôt play the game and your base takes down a dragon or more dragons than that, you don‚Äôt earn points for the water dragon, I recently knocked down 2 dragons but my points are still 12. I knocked down on dragon before and still I didn‚Äôt get a point. Please fix a bug that when you leave the game and you knocked dragons down when you come back into the game, please make it earn points so you can use the water dragon.  You need to fix the invoker class: instead of using 4 shots and the last one casts a powerful spell, it should shoot 7 plasma beams and it could be a plasma beam each and the last one casts a powerful plasma beam, enough to destroy the entire base.', 'This game is like no other. It‚Äôs based off skill and your abilities and dedication, not just those who pay for everything are all powerful. After you pas the tutorial and start to level, things get easier and come quickly, and makes it so much fun! I quit for some time since I felt frustrated against high leveled players, but I came back and realized it only took dedication and never giving up to learn my way around. It gets better as you go, and even those at the top never stop seeking thrills and new experiences! My only suggestion would be a defense battle chat, and maybe a voice chat system for both attacking and defending with your team. That would make things easier in battle. Otherwise, the game is absolutely stunning and amazing, and even with the highest graphics enabled, I‚Äôm still able to fly with little to no lag, and the battle is 100% in real time happening with anyone who joins in. With events almost every day to compile into the seasons with exclusive items, the game just keeps adding new surprises, updates, and more fun to the amazing experience it already is. Why are you still reading this??? Download the game already! It‚Äôs definitely worth it and will make things much more thrilling in life when you have free time! Join the community! :)', 'I have been playing this game since about 2016, and it‚Äôs something I always check on every once in a while and grind out a bit. I recently advanced past player level 420. I will say this, the sapphire dragons take a very long time to get past, but it will be done eventually if you‚Äôre smart about it. I like the combat system, it‚Äôs something that separates it from a lot of other base building games, and it allows for a more in-depth management of your arsenal. I have been seeing some sentiment that this game has become a bit of a pay-to-win, and I understand where this comes from. The shop and its offers are plentiful and prolific, and are dangled in front of the player many times during the game. There are some powerful lower tier dragons that cost rubies to get, instead of breeding them normally through the token system. Rubies, mind you, are a pretty inefficient currency, and the in-game transactions get so resource-intensive that they seem to devalue them. But the season rewards and chests earned from the events tend to give plenty of rewards that cover these. The method to not spend money on this game is two main things: persistence and playing your cards smartly.', 'I love this game. It never strikes me boring or unsatisfying, like games I usually play. I never get bored, because it‚Äôs always a new thing to do or accomplish. It‚Äôs also so satisfying and when you get a hard earned dragon or finally upgrade that storage vault; So nice! I especially love it when we win team wars or go to the next team ranking, but there‚Äôs one problem I‚Äôd love to fix. Why does it cost money to do so much??? If you could finish the game without paying the money for it, then people might start respecting that and start playing more, or buying packs to make it exciting. It‚Äôs hard to stay satisfied when this happens, and what about people who don‚Äôt have access to money, like children who have parents who won‚Äôt pay for the game? I say people should definitely get this game, but you should also fix this problem, especially in ember. I loved it when I dominated a base three levels higher then me easily in one go with ember, but now I‚Äôm at the point where ember is starting to not be powerful, because I don‚Äôt spend money on games and can‚Äôt level him up. I feel like my efforts were wasted and I almost quit. So war dragons team, if you read this, please fix this problem! Thanks for the time and effort.']"

The games humor is great from random comments from the game or making fun or references to other games/shows. The aspect of it being all a television show is a great concept and really shines well in this game.

This game is fun, quirky, and self-aware in all the right places, and delivers a heartwarming story, despite it‚Äôs goofy nature of actors flipping around in spandex suits fighting monsters like traffic wizards and bird people.That being said, the only downside one might find with this game is the necessity of near-perfection on it‚Äôs higher difficulty. If you enjoy lots of trial and error in simply choosing your characters for your squad (something you have to restart the entire game to change, by the way), then the hard difficulty is up your alley.All in all, this is an excellent game for both sides of gamers. It can be played on easy and delivers an excellent story and allows new players to get a feel for turn based strategy games if they aren‚Äôt familiar with them, and offers an exceptionally difficult mode of the game where every turn could quite literally cost you the entire level if you misstep, and the medium difficulty for those who want a taste of both. It‚Äôs by no means perfect (as there are a few small bugs, I mainly noticed the occasional screen flash of certain sprites up close, but this doesn‚Äôt really hamper the gameplay). Definitely check this one out.', 'I am interested about ‚Äúplease. Chroma squad 2‚Äù so this is a response. I want a chroma squad 2 as much as he/she does too.

PPS: please respond to this #ChromaS2 PPPS:figured out group name, the name is (spoilers play til last episode of season 3 to figure out name of the group)', 'Like I said the game is pretty enjoyable, especially for its price. The only complaint I have (and its a big one) is how often you can get extremely with the bonus objectives. A lot of the missions have multiple battles in the same mission, and if your party dies or you want to restart because of a failed bonus objective, you have to start from the beginning of that mission and redo all of the battles (they can be tedious). That isn‚Äôt such a huge deal if it was completely reliant on skill, but it isn‚Äôt always. For example, on the 3rd fight of a mission it wants you to kill 4 enemies in a single turn. AOE attacks are in short supply at this point, so you basically have to one shot them individually. Well, most of your party has to use a long cool down ability to do that, and if it misses you can kiss that bonus objective goodbye, or redo the mission and the tedious drawn out fights that happened before the one you failed. That‚Äôs one example but not the only one, and if you play it I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll see what I mean.', 'I am a really big power rangers fan from the heart, I am not as interested in it as much as I used to be but still. I actually made a review about this game where I basically destroyed it, but I realize this game was quite good. I love rpgs, and this no slacker in that department. And for Power Rangers, this game has an amazing story that you choose, with multiple endings. I also love the fact that the Megazords or ‚ÄòMechas‚Äô are incorporated into this game too! Overall this game is quite spectacular. But, there is some content that is not for younger players, like some mature dialogue and a bikini fish monster. There might a few other things too, but still. Once you overlook the bad things, this game is awesome! I love the music, and even the Chroma Squad‚Äôs theme song! I actually even made a video of my Power Rangers fighting a boxing box, literally!

If you enjoy turn-based strategies, power rangers, or Knights of Pen and Paper, you'll love this. The controls aren't confusing and the tutorial isn't long at all. When you push the star icon your ranger will strike a pose. From there you can either use that ranger as a springboard to toss the other rangers greater distances, or if the posed character is next to an enemy, the next ranger to attack said enemy will perform a double attack with the posed ranger. You can position multiple rangers to perform combo attacks, using four rangers with the fifth attacking will unleash your finishing move."", ""I downloaded this game on a whim and was quite surprised at how funny, witty, fun, and addicting it was. You can customize your squad and mech which is always a plus in my opinion. I would like it if there were more choices of classes but hopefully they'll add those in. The big gripes I have are the studio upgrades.....the buttons don't work after the first season and it's really frustrating. I save all this money and can't use it 98% on the studio. That needs to be fixed asap. Also, I would like a save option for the middle of a battle.

In certain scenes, achieving all director's requests is not possible (it matters even if you've maximized the audience by other means). If they are there, it should be possible to accomplish them all, in any difficulty. Some minions and bosses are too powerful on the early game, reducing tactical possibilities. After all, if a mere minion (from a initial bunch of 6) can knock down a character in two attacks - needing three characters to do the opposite - and you can not resurrect anyone, at most use heal (not help much on these extreme grounds, just postpone your doom one or two rounds), some balance is needed."", 'A nice little tongue and cheek Sentai strategy RPG also Grimmgarl, Tornaq, and Muligahn from Colossal Kaiju Combat was a genuinely pleasant surprise.

They haven‚Äôt even come out with balance changes in almost a year now and daily challenges are always recycled. It is very hard to start this game this late in its life because you are at a disadvantage because back in the early life of the game a lot of cards had a lower rarity than they do now (ex. Super rare cards that used to be rare) which made the cards more easily craftable. So new players don‚Äôt have that opportunity. My idea too keep the players left on this game is that the developers needs to let players have more creativity. One thing I would really like is private custom matches with friends.

Second I‚Äôd like to address the online battle. PvZ needs to do better at match making. There isn‚Äôt no reason why a level 14 player should be facing a level 30 player or higher. It‚Äôs just not fair. Lastly and most importantly is the super blocking system I don‚Äôt understand how it works and it seems random based when the hero is hit but it needs to be regulated some how. I was just in a match with my super block at 80% with 8 health. When the opponent attacked me, I lost and my super block meter moved one square which made no sense to me. I should‚Äôve blocked his attack. Also the block meter filling needs to be fix as well. What I mean by that is when a person gets attacked by a lower level card the block meter will fill multiple squares but a card that has a high attack will on fill only couple squares. That makes no sense. It should be the other way around, when attacked by a high attack level card the super block meter should fill more than being hit by a lower level card.', 'This game was fun up until the plant quests became so hard it was like trying to paint a wall with a toothpick. It would be easier if there were a wider selection of packs, and it was easier to get gems. Also, up until world eleven, you can beat the levels but you may lose here and there. And I get it. I mean, I have lost a few myself. But I have been stuck on the boss of world eleven for six days. And the Zombie one is a bit easier, since I am only on world three in there, but it still is hard. Just make it easier to get packs, and I will up my rating. I also want to say that the bosses get so hard it is literally impossible to beat that world. I would not recommend this game if you hate having your opponent to have the upper hand and the lucky cards every. Single. Round. Please make the computer weaker because it gets so hard that it is  not possible to beat. Also, Since EA never listens to ANY comments, I am not sure why I have this crappy game in the first place. What EA should be doing is actually listening to the many complaints that they are getting. Absolute trash. I would rather stare at the wall than play an ad fest with an occasional overpowered pay to win battle. P.S. if you are hunkymonkey19 and you are reading this, use other plant heroes to try and win. If that does not work, then lose a bunch of battles and the game will give you a free pack for green shadow. I tried it and it gave me a super rare and I was able to beat the level. Cya!', 'PvZ Heroes, right? It‚Äôs a really great game. It‚Äôs super fun to play online, it‚Äôs pretty, it‚Äôs creative, but in my opinion, there are some certain things that ruin it for me. One thing is how much it feels like you have the grind out the game to get efficient decks. Sure, the Gacha rates are pretty decent, but it feels like advancing your deck just requires too much time on this game. It isn‚Äôt horrible, but it just leaves something to desire.Now one thing I very much dislike about this game isn‚Äôt even about the game itself. The game just... loves crashing. It just does. Whenever you‚Äôre into a game and you are about to win, the game just crashes. And it‚Äôs unexplainable how it does, because back when I had my old account, the game ran perfectly with no issues, but with my new phone (iPhone 7 it‚Äôs not really that new) it just crashes randomly.But otherwise, I don‚Äôt think this game has much to improve other than single player features. The single player is... okay. It‚Äôs just kinda a feature that exists, yknow? There‚Äôs nothing different from it than dumb cpu and occasionally unfair boss battles.The game is good but it needs improvement and bug fixes. Fin.Edit to this review: GOD THE CRASHING IS ANNOYING. Could you guys PLEASE fix this problem? It‚Äôs like whenever I‚Äôm winning it crashes.', 'Pretty cool concept would be better it‚Äôs made by somebody else heels are so stupid in this gameWheneverYou get here you get a shield peace and if the shield pieces all line up you get a block attack the thing is how many Shield pieces you get is random so Little Timmy 444 could get three shield pieces and block a incredibly strong attack but you could need to shield pieces to block attack that does 10 damage and you will get one that could determine if you win the game or not also in my opinion plant skills referring to the skills that go on the card should only be activated before the round starts battling because randomly you would have the perfect set up and then randomly he put down the corn does for damage to all your people and you lose Not to mention it‚Äôs a pay to win if you really spend your money to max out The best heroes which are the tree stump the zombie on the floating chair and the scientist then you‚Äôre basically unstoppable in the early game and may be in the medium game because you just have so many cars that are unstoppable and Scarlet 22 isn‚Äôt going to know what to do if you start placing the cards that zero of her cards counter.       SoOverall review if you‚Äôre down to spend money on this game then you‚Äôre going to have probably a great time but it‚Äôs not it‚Äôs still can be fun but if you hate luck based games don‚Äôt download', 'They have been trying to balance the game a lot lately and that‚Äôs great but they may have done too much at ones with the last expansion they got a tiny bit sloppy .... it‚Äôs hard to contact EA with a complaint without dedicating way too much time so I‚Äôm trying my luck here. First Immorticia‚Äôs bat ability clams to be amphibious but you still can‚Äôt play it in the water lane ..... force field (environment: plants can‚Äôt be hurt) and soul Patch (card: takes damage instead of your hero) should not be able to be a total win con (there is absolutely no way to kill him when he‚Äôs in environment without another environment ) it‚Äôs circumstantial  but it‚Äôs still too OP . These two have been problems for a while (Immortica‚Äôs not as long) they use to fix stuff way faster they have more cards now but still it feels like no one in charge is playing the game just throwing out ideas .... it‚Äôs fun but with all the crazy things you can do no one would see all the glitches without playing themselves... would still highly recommend just trying to get things patched without spending forever figuring out how to reach EA .....they have a lot more weirdness but those are the things that made me loss today lol .', 'I swear to God, since Christmas the bonus plant hero‚Äôs have only been either Spudow or Captain Combustible. Often times it‚Äôs been the same one two weeks in a row. I‚Äôm completely fed up with it and am about to permanently quit this game. I used to occasionally drop some money on this, but since the repetition started I‚Äôve stopped because I don‚Äôt want to drop money to possibly not be able to use the cards I get. The main thing that keeps me invested in the game is earning the event cards, so I can eventually play them. Used to be that you‚Äôd get to play them plenty the following week when the bonus hero would be a deck that used those cards. Now that‚Äôs both not happening, I don‚Äôt feel like playing the same hero for the millionth time in a row in the past three months, and I‚Äôm quickly losing interest without the feeling of something to progress towards. I tried to report this in game multiple times to someone who might try to suggest doing something about this and never received anything other than ‚Äúthank you for your feed back‚Äù or what was essentially ‚Äúnot my department‚Äù. Now you have this feedback permanently negatively impacting your rating for everyone to see. If you don‚Äôt want to also permanently lose the chance of getting money from me again change your system back to not allowing repeat hero or hero types for the plant heros. At the very least, work some solar or smarty heros in there every couple of weeks. This has been ridiculous.', 'First of all I feel like they could make Beta-Carrotina and Huge-Gigantacus easier to get. The only time I get the packs is during Christmas and even then you only have a 5% chance of getting them. I feel their packs should cost less since you have a very slim chance of getting the hero and I spent about 1500 gems and didn‚Äôt even get a legendary card. Another thing I don‚Äôt like is that there are some glitches that bother me. The first one is that sometimes when a weak attack hits me the ‚ÄúSuper Block Meter‚Äù is filled without breaking it goes a while without breaking then finally it works. Once I had an experience where my block meter was one away from being filled and I had almost beaten my opponent when the meter doesn‚Äôt work PLEASE FIX THIS. Another glitch that is less annoying but still irritating is that when you‚Äôre doing Plant/Zombie Missions the game suddenly starts moving at at least 2x regular speed and I don‚Äôt even know what is going on. Finally the developers haven‚Äôt updated the cards in a long time, I know the developers are trying but I‚Äôm getting tired of just using the same old cards. It says the Triassic Triumph cards are ‚ÄúALL-NEW‚Äù but, in fact they‚Äôve been out for at least 2 years. But besides the things I mentioned I think the game is awesome just like a real card game.', 'I‚Äôve spent a minimum of 20 hours on this game. After all this time this is probably the best mobile app on the App Store, without doubt. However this is just for casual players. Once you begin to climb the ranks and become higher, there are like 3 decks that you can win with and if you‚Äôre not using those decks you automatically lose. The freezing deck just obliterates everything professor brainstorm is way too good for early players and the pecanolith is way too overpowered . The daily challenges are great for the less ambitious players. The final thing I want to say is about the missions and the shop. 1. The missions, the missions are great and put you in certain situations but it‚Äôd be cooler if you got like 15 gems every time you beat a section ( it takes 100 gems to get a pack ) . 2. This game is made by EA, or at least the alternate version so this is obviously pay to win. This game is even more pay to win than any other game I‚Äôve played. If you‚Äôve spent at least 50$ on this game you‚Äôre guaranteed rank 40 at least. It‚Äôs ridiculous how much of a difference it makes. You could have a 1/1 powered card and the enemy would have a 2/2 card that gets bonus cards when it attacks and makes them cheaper. This game is imbalanced but a good game. Recommended for people who spend money on games often and casual gamers.']"
1265355382,"['Tim Conkling and his expert team have created the ultimate digital board gaming experience by bringing role-playing, strategy, exploration, action, and resource gathering elements together into one single game and...yes, it all happens on a board. That is to say...if you are a fan of any of these elements...you‚Äôll be extremely happy to play Antihero.    A high replay of royal treasure value exists here! There is a Skirmish mode that allows you to play against AI or a friend via pass n play. The Online mode will give you a chance to play those who are further than an arm‚Äôs reach of you and, if that wasn‚Äôt enough, there‚Äôs even a Campaign mode that offers challenges with each level/stage. The chances for a person to get bored with this game is next to nil. (In my mind, the best value on the entire AppStore at this time.)    Music, artwork, and character voices are incredible and suit the theme of Antihero perfectly. I rarely hit the credits button on a game but I felt compelled to acknowledge every member of the supporting staff behind the game that has set the bar on digital board games. My only gripe is that there are too many to name here individually. But I sincerely want to thank each one personally so...THANK YOU SO MUCH! I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if more gamers do the same as I after playing this crown jewel.    To sum it up: THIS IS A MUST PLAY!', 'I‚Äôve been playing Antihero, the first great mobile digital board game of 2018. You play a Master Thief in a Victorian setting. Your turn-based tasks are to scout and burgle hidden locations, build up your thieves‚Äô guild, hire and deploy your army of thugs, street urchins, and other underworld characters. But wait, each level is a race against a rival Master Thief and guild. If your rival beats you to the coveted victory points by achieving each level‚Äôs objectives (bribes, assassinations, etc.) before you, you are defeated, and must restart the level. Gameplay is brisk and the learning curve is gentle in the early going, gradually building the challenge as you progress. Strategy comes in the form of various upgrade decisions: do you spend your limited resources first to attract more street urchins, so they can infiltrate and earn money? Or do you focus on beefing up your gang of thugs to guard your turf and block the opposing gang‚Äôs progress? Presentation is polished, with appropriate graphics that evoke the gaslight era, and brief voice clips that define each character as you issue them orders (ala Warcraft ‚Äî ‚ÄúYes, my lord!‚Äù). It‚Äôs a premium game with only cosmetic characters reskins available via IAP ‚Äî no pay-to-win here. It has quickly shot to the first spot on my iPad games screen. Highly recommended.', 'I‚Äôm a huge board gamer, and was honestly very impressed by the mechanics of the game. It‚Äôs sort of like Stratego meets Monopoly. My only complaint is that the game is too short, and even on Hard, is a little too easy (but that‚Äôs subjective). The campaign only has ten levels, and first few are just tutorial-style; probably only two or three levels where all units are unlocked. I beat the whole thing in under three hours, which is fine for just a few bucks. But even the Skirmishes against AI are pretty repetitive, and skirmishes against real players feels like Words With Friends‚Äîwaiting for the other person to take turns means games last for days on end, and you end up starting so many that you forget what‚Äôs happening. I wish they‚Äôd made more levels since the game is wildly addicting.Also, the win conditions boil down to mainly the same strategy and is slightly unbalanced. Make a gang, protect the gang‚Äôs movements with thugs, rinse and repeat. Gangs are just so OP since they can clear out buildings, can generate up to 3 gold a kill, and can assassinate for victory points. Why even bother with other units when you can just spam and protect gangs? A fully stocked bank makes the same money per turn as a fully upgraded gang.', ""Everything about the game from its art to its flavor to its play is great. But the campaign is extremely frustrating because the AI opponent is so overpowered. Rather than having an even, if asymmetrical, playing field, you feel as if your strategy doesn't matter because it's more of a case of having to do specific moves in a specific order to win. The AI opponent gets powers of the bat that might take you 10 rounds to earn for yourself which completely undermines the area control aspect. If the opponent can evict you in round two and you can't get that power until round twelve, why even try to control the area? It's unfair even to call it an AI because it doesn't have any intelligence. It doesn't change its strategy according to your moves. It just uses brute force to disable you. That is my least favorite kind of solo game -- one that acts like a random puzzle where if you don't make the right move in round one that will defeat the opponent, you've already lost. It's a shame because everything else is so cool."", 'The best mobile game I‚Äôve purchased, and the only app I‚Äôve ever been so impressed by that I felt it worth taking the time to write a review.  Purchased this while on a work trip, and ended up playing the campaign mode 2-3 hours straight the first time.  Great graphics, music and gameplay as mentioned in the other reviews.I love that you can play offline while flying in airplane mode, then go online after you‚Äôve completed the campaign to play against other people.  It gives you two ways to play online, live where you play till completion, or turn based.   I usually opt for turn cases since you can play a quick move and play at your leisure over a couple days when you have a few minutes.Only feature I would request is a time limit of some sort (maybe 2-3 days?), where if an opponent hasn‚Äôt made a move they automatically forfeit.  I don‚Äôt know if there is already something like this in place, but I‚Äôve had a couple matches where I was winning and it was getting toward the end and my online opponent just stops and hasn‚Äôt made a move in a couple days.  I hope there is another campaign in the works, or an expansion of some sort.  Would love more levels to play offline.  Overall love this game!  Great work!', 'Well put together board game. Lots of depth in strategizing what to upgrade, when to upgrade, where to place folks and when to strike.

There‚Äôs definitely potential for more, but the price is a steal for what you get already. I‚Äôll keep an eye on this developer because, so far, I‚Äôm LOVING their work and would really like to keep supporting them. And a big THANK YOU for bringing a premium priced game with voluntary and sensible IAPs. It‚Äôs a breath of some very much needed fresh air for the iOS/tvOS platforms!

To beat the campaign on hard will take you a while between learning the game mechanics, absorbing tactical nuances (ex. scouting a place that likely has a trap last), to developing your strategy to win.The game is well balanced. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be a dominant strategy and there are counters to everything.Unfortunately, the multiplayer seems more dead than expected. The ‚Äúpostal‚Äù version of multiplayer works, but once again, not as lively as expected for a game of this caliber. The ‚Äúlive match‚Äù version of multiplayer, which I prefer, is dead, period. I‚Äôve never managed to get a match.In addition, the login system for multiplayer is just amateur. You guys are obviously very talented app developers; put in a little more work to make the multiplayer login seamless.Also no iCloud synchronization. I think that sentence speaks for itself.

Thank you.', 'I wish that these developers would allow you to play a portion of the game before purchase. This has been in my recommended games for years. I purchased. I didn‚Äôt care for it.

1290392434,"['So far I am really enjoying this game. It‚Äôs fun, we‚Äôll balanced, and offers a lot to explore. I do have so ideas for the dev team though. I‚Äôd like to be able to see more of an enemy‚Äôs stats. Maybe a way to do that is to have a specialized scouting party that can scout only Main Cities, and then have a longer delay on how often you can use that scouting party. The details would include total forces, total city count, and the other stats from equipment and the like. Another change would be the ability to abandon the cities in an area that you aren‚Äôt operating in. This can open areas up to others in that area. Lastly, the fact that I can‚Äôt attack someone‚Äôs cities if they haven‚Äôt been on in a while is frustrating. I have multiple enemies around me that haven‚Äôt been online in a while (or at least that what I assume) and the game tell me that my troops aren‚Äôt motivated to attack that city. Maybe there should be some kind of way to allow the cities to be taken over, but still preserve the idle player‚Äôs progression by moving them to a different location? It‚Äôs just frustrating to be surrounded by 20+ cities that you can‚Äôt attack. Other than that, the game is a blast. Going to war against other players and strategizing in the heat of the moment is exciting and a little bit addictive!', 'This game is very fair and doesn‚Äôt require you to spend money at all. While you can spend money to get ahead some it won‚Äôt be the difference between being first or last. You can really only buy your way up to top 50ish and that‚Äôs if you throw lots and lots of money which I think is fair because you can buy your troops they die over and over u til yo I get into the top percent of the game. Then you can no longer buy them back with gems. You can earn 50 gems a day through 2 daily quests and every 2 hours if you watch a ad you can get 10 gems. You can get them fairly easy and if you save them up you can use them to buy weapon experts that auto switch between defensive, offensive, and production gear to help you out. You can do it all manually too if you‚Äôd like. I‚Äôve been apart of the game for a couple months now and with every season there‚Äôs a big reset and everyone‚Äôs level one again which is great because if you‚Äôre not doing so well, oh well reset and try again next season. The only thing I would recommend to the developers is to maybe implement a larger area around each city that kinda turns a color like some other war games when you occupy a territory. Or make each clan have the ability to design a unique castle of sorts like we do with characters. Just something to make it a little easier to differentiate between people and clans!

We always take into account ideas and suggestions, and they might appear later on in game!', 'I really enjoy this game and the unique style of play it provides. I do not like to play games that have a pay-to-win strategy and that is one of the best features this game has. While purchasing perks does benefit you, it is not extremely overpowering. One of my biggest complaints is the fact that you cannot cancel marches once you move them. While I get that ‚Äúwalling‚Äù is a good strategy for defense, sometimes you may select the wrong amount of troops to send, which may greatly impact how long it will take them to arrive. This also goes for recalling troops to one city. If you recall troops from all surrounding cities then the time is dictated for all marches by how long the furthest march takes. Of course, like many other users, another feature I‚Äôd like to see get an overhaul is the clan system. Whether it‚Äôs the ability to support their cities with your troops, gift them daily gold, or other features that make joining a clan worthwhile.

Second, adding chain links to city taking. I have seen people attack on the other side of the map. Guilds could be a part of this attack links of nearby cities like the scouts. Make them have to expand outwards and not just be able to attack this one tile out in the middle of nowhere. Third, the main city function. Due to this game you are not able to incapacitate your enemy for long before they just start throwing a lot of small numbers in random areas. It creates a ripple especially with the fact that you can only hit a certain amount of cities before they become ‚Äútoo weak‚Äù. And if you can‚Äôt attack the main city, then why does it have a defense stat??? Seems kinda redundant. Guild chat is also kinda buggy as well as multiple troop function bugs like them disappearing without reason. Ill send a troop to attack a city and they will just be gone, no report, nothing. Overall a good game and would really like to see it developed but right now, it‚Äôs just to forgiving with people being surrounded and what not.', 'Thank you for your support!

I have a history with this sort of game and the mechanics of this one are very addicting. There are a few problems I‚Äôd like to address. 1. Demotivation; I understand the point of it. Many games of this type aren‚Äôt kind enough to the player base to have something like this. I believe the feature needs some work. Players with a fraction of you‚Äôre power can build massive armies and attack your cities. You then have no way to get these cities back under your control. I suggest a feature where once you are attacked your soldiers have ‚Äúmotivation‚Äù to attack the smaller players. This motivation would last for a short while and keep small players from eating away at progress. 2. Communication; it is very difficult to talk to and find players in this game. It is near impossible to find exact locations of various players. Private chats would solve the communication problems. For finding players it would be useful if your clan mates location showed up when you zoomed out on the map. Also if you were able to drop pins and send them in chats that would clear up much confusion. 3. Bugs; I know these will be fixed in time, but whenever buttons on my HUD are constantly glitching I find it difficult to play the game. I love this game and hope you developers read this and take something from it. Thank you!', 'This game is amazing... it‚Äôs very addicting and a big feature is that it isn‚Äôt really pay to win.

Also a system where you could also send them reinforcements.. because when my clan members get attacked then I could only hit back the encamp and take it for myself...

And i attacked him a couple times then I was no longer allowed to attack him! You can only attack people who are larger or similar strength.

I feel that the clan system should be more interactive and you can actually find your clan mates instead of looking everywhere and if it‚Äôs possible a mini map of some sorts and at the beginning of the season with a fresh start you should be able to start near guild members, and I think the introducing of races would be fun like for example the panthers would be good defender, lions good attackers, humans balanced, I just feel like it‚Äôd give the game more depth.

After playing for a few months though, it‚Äôs just a slightly more fun version of every pay to win mobile game out there. They advertise that it‚Äôs not pay to win, but the difference between players who are obviously buying a lot of gems to get ahead and those that don‚Äôt is painfully obvious. Got to a point where I couldn‚Äôt defend my cities and I couldn‚Äôt attack the players around me with any success, and I‚Äôm not paying real money to keep up so it lost the fun at that point. Some suggestions for improvement: improve the clan chat interface, have to back out and go back in through a few weird clicks currently. Also would be nice to have a better world map, when you zoom out it often doesn‚Äôt load so if someone shares a city you‚Äôll zoom out and have no idea how close your cities are to it.', 'This is a very enjoyable game so far. It incentivized you to keep playing and keep attacking, it isn‚Äôt necessarily pay to win (although you can pay for chests and advisors that help a good amount), and it allows for low level and high level players to coexist. It reminds me of an old game for pc called Call of the Warlords, which is exactly what I was looking for. This game could use improvement in the way of allowing for multiple strategies, not just making the meta maxing attack and non stop attacking other players. It would also be pretty cool to add a feature like Call of the Warlords had where you had heroes for your armies and you could equip each hero with different items and level them up for bonuses to that army, with camps / dungeons all around the map to conquer that have items for said heroes.', ""Thank you so much for your support, Skillet5yt!

For the community filters I think you could add filtering cards by color some people said by type but that‚Äôs too much. It would be cool to have enchantment creatures or artifacts creatures too, and it would be cool to see the vintage designs for cards.

I know coding is hard so you don‚Äôt have to put all of these in one update or even all of them you can just put a few or one.

While the app in its current state isn‚Äôt perfect, this is essentially a long-term two-man project, as far as I am aware, and the app is being gradually yet noticeably improved with each passing month.I find that this project is done professionally and cleanly enough that the patron support is worth it as-is. I feel that the art of making your own Magic cards is a reward in and of itself, and this is further enabled by the (mostly) free and (extremely) easy-to-understand features of the app.Furthermore, I appreciate the total lack of ads anywhere on CardCreator, even though that may be a regional thing (I‚Äôm in the US). This small gesture alone tells me that the developers are decent people and deserve my support and the support of others that use the app as frequently as do I.*TL;DR*The app is more than worth it, free or with the subscription option (which only affects the community tab and some border/rarity options on card templates.

It also looks like this app hasn‚Äôt been updated in 2 years so it‚Äôs not likely going to get fixed. I would definitely become a patron to unlock the extras, but not when the basic functionality is thus broken.

Usually by constantly opening it, the app starts up but I have loaded the app 30 or more times now and each time it immediately crashes soon after.

The camera needs to be fixed so you can zoom out and see more of the train station. Even at farthest away it's too close sometimes at some of the stations.2. Desperately need landscape instead of just portrait viewing. Combined with too close camera, portrait viewing just doesn't allow you to see well. Also it is annoying to have to play with the power cord always at the bottom. 3. Game progress can be a little slow, MAKING MONEY TAKES FOREVER!

There are some issues that I‚Äôve noticed and I‚Äôm late for major issues. I enjoyed the game so much I created many different accounts to keep me going for extra Parmesan everything else. But as of late every single account has now been on banded and I have no way to get into them and I have no way to start A new one. I do not remember what cities all my accounts were in acceptable. All I‚Äôm looking for some results on getting my account fixed so I can play again for as of now I cannot play the game interview developers release the Apple ID that has been used in their server so I can start a new. This is a great game. If you want to get ahead of the game quickly yes you do need to spend some money some of the packs a great some of the pantry very expensive. I applied to game without iron which takes a long time to get anywhere and I‚Äôm also spent on other matters. Or cities so all in all great game I think you could be cleaned up and have some of the minor issues fixed. I do believe the story line could be a little better I did notice though as the story goes all of a sudden it stops talking in the storyline changes so I think if you guys will create a better story line it would be great power and all all I would like to do is be able to play again.

For the longest time I thought these games are just ways companies make easy money. This game has really been a different story for me, the clan I joined actually talk to each other and want to become stronger, the developers send me tips and event messages daily, the whole game is fun again for me.

I have no resources or troops left and I‚Äôm just stuck rebuilding. You start to feel like a supplier for whichever jerk wants to completely decimate your game that night. It‚Äôs frustrating.

In this game the spending is gradually increased over time the higher lvls you achieve. I love the game the entertainment value from the people on the game at least in my experience, is worth every penny I've spent so far. I do wish more resources and speed ups were put in the 99 packs or they sold exclusive resources and speedups packs but other than that, it's good to go.

Yes realms are divided, but whoever has the right amount of cash to throw at the game will be over 1b might in a week, and that player can just as easily attack lower level players with no penalty or restriction. ‚ÄúCompetitive‚Äù (very big players who most likely spent thousandths to grow insanely large in a brief amount of time) clans will zero others for no reason other than to flex their muscles outside of kill events. Case in point, I had an elder account and got a small account in a younger realm. The leader in my new realm managed to surpass my might-which took me over 6 months to build spending a reasonable amount-in less than a month just paying for stats. Players who know nothing about the game, but can build insane might overnight and get bored and go hunt others. Unfortunately what other players have stated is true, now I don‚Äôt spend or spend the bare minimum knowing it can all be destroyed in a couple of hours if I run out of shields. So yes it‚Äôs fun to build, but if you don‚Äôt plan on spending an insane amount of money, you won‚Äôt be on any lb ever just based on hard work and learning the game.

Player feedback is truly important to us and as our passionate communities are what make our games great. The mechanic of merges is truly done out of a means of preserving the health of the game and to fit players into competitions that make sense as they progress. This is to avoid repetition in a realm and encourage engagement with new players. We find this often leads to players developing new competitive strategies we have not thought possible! Realm merges are not something done without careful thought and are regularly reviewed to keep realms healthy. We do our best to give plenty of notice before a merge and provide exceptions to players in these realms to assist them with moving if they are uncomfortable with the new competition.

With all the recent updates, it has focused on the strongest growing much stronger - and the weaker not being able to even grow close. As well (as many others have pointed out), there‚Äôs a system of troop kills, and it‚Äôs easy and incentivized for the top people to ‚Äúzero‚Äù or kill every troop of lower players. This gets really annoying since people lose almost 3-4 months of progress and the attacker didn‚Äôt lose anything. I feel like there needs some changes in higher town hall people attacking lower ones, similar to how you do it for slaughter events - maybe make it so attacking requires energy, and for each town hall lower you attack, it requires more energy. This makes it so higher players will need lots of energy to attack someone around 5 town halls lower, but now have to fight each other to get troop kills. As well, I am pretty sure people wouldn‚Äôt mind using 100 brew or something to attack someone lower but get tons of loot (so it‚Äôs still incentivized to attack over cap people).

My favorite part about this app is that they have the actual numbers for all the abilities of the champs. Not even the league client has that. I will definitely be using this app more because of the abilities numbers. The reason I gave it four stars is because i feel like the match history is hard to look at. It would be nicer if all the players werent on a list and you have to scroll down. I recommend making it one page and have all ten players on a chart so it's easier to compare things such as lane partners, cs, kda and so on. The current one is just hard to look at as you have to scroll up and down. A recommendation for this app is to make a tab for current champion sales and skins sales as well as the free champions of the week. I know I may be asking for too much but another cool feature that would make this awesome would be to add a page for lane matchup counters list and tips for each matchup.

Another thing is that I think in sandbox mode, you should be able to select certain meteors like Aphophis or Chicxulub, besides all of these problems, this game is really fun and worth it', 'The game is a similar setup to Plague, a game which I loved. However, the only factor is the impact point itself, with no other factors like flooding or earthquakes or even environmental changes that would normal have some global effects regardless of where the asteroid hit. Also, the game tells you to maximize damage potential by targeting densely populated cities, but then have of the most densely populated cities in the world don‚Äôt seem to be big enough to warrant higher points. I don‚Äôt understand why it also doesn‚Äôt take into account shockwave damage to surrounding areas as the asteroid shots get larger. So, if you use one of the first smaller asteroids on say a city in India, you have a rating of 1.75 for multiplier points, but that doesn‚Äôt change if you wait to hit that same city until later when you have a large enough asteroid to wipe out the entire country. Likewise, you could use one of your larger asteroids to wipe out all of North America or all of Europe or east Asia, but the multiplier points would still only be around 1.20 or even 1.10....if you are wiping out an entire country because the asteroid is ten miles wide instead of half a mile wide, that doesn‚Äôt make any sense.', 'Hi JMag, the game always computes the efficiency of your strike, that is the damage in relation to the impact area of your asteroid (including the shockwave). A tiny asteroid in India will cause major damage within all of its shockwave radius, whereas a large one would release a lot of its energy into the sea (so it is less ‚Äöefficient‚Äô so to say). India is much more densely populated than North America, so the multiplier will always be higher there. The app uses a statistical dataset for the population distribution, so it should give fairly plausible results. Hope that makes things clear for you!', 'I love this game, I really do, I just have one small issue- I can‚Äôt beat level/chapter 7. I‚Äôve probably tried it 50 times, and I‚Äôm no better than when I tried the first time. If you could balance the difficulty, maybe increase the meteors you get or make it so you kill 75% of the population instead of 85%, that‚Äôd be great. Also, you should make a sandbox mode where you have infinite meteors. And a mode where you kill a singular city, like you zoom in and you can see individual buildings and stuff and you need to destroy the whole city, so like the fist city could be New York, and then Paris, and then Rome, and on and on. Otherwise, it‚Äôs a GREAT game and I‚Äôm excited to see where it goes!', 'Thanks a lot for your feedback, happy to see you like the game so much!

The earth is beautiful and the lighting and textures are top notch, especially on newer devices. It‚Äôs quite challenging and fairly gratifying. Timing the day to night is very important in finding populated areas.I would like to see more dramatic impacts as well as the asteroids coming in from space, as is it looks more like nukes exploding on the surface instead of objects from space.Overall, the game is clean, fast and to the point.

The end results are blotting out ‚Äúlights‚Äù on a world map with no graphic appeal.

The more interesting and demanding challenges actually start in the second half of the game, the first levels are just meant as a basic warmup. Going forward, we will see how to make the opening more exciting as you are not the only one who got discouraged to progress after the comparably slow start.', 'I really love how realistic it is, but I would also LOVE to see more destruction. It‚Äôs a bit vulgar I know; however seeing the amount of people that the meteor has killed, or the amount of damage caused(using currency) would be awesome! For example: wiping out all of India or something would give me a billion deaths. Or 100 Billion Dollars worry of destruction. Also. It would be nice to see a little bit more detail in the explosion. Like maybe a physical meteor coming down and colliding earth. And as multipliers increase, the meteor becomes larger and larger.And finally, the animation is ok, but it could be improved with other things like mushroom clouds, fire instead of darkness of lights, and explosions.This is one of the best $0.99 game I have played. And with a little more improvement, it would be THE best $0.99 game I have ever played!Thanks!', 'First off I love this game, the visuals are beautiful, but I‚Äôve beaten this game a couple of times now, so sometimes I just like to mess around and take out certain countries and not worry about the main objective, but some of the levels make it hard to do so since they will lower your multiplier and what not, so this game would be perfect if it had either a level select option or a sandbox option for players who have beaten the game.', 'Hi Brendan, thanks a lot for your valuable feedback! I totally agree that a more freestyle sandbox mode makes a lot of sense for the game.', 'I was assuming I was going to see asteroids hit the earth and have control of black holes like a sandbox game is. But it‚Äôs not,I‚Äôm glad it was only 99 cents. I would be really upset if it cost more than $1 dollar. Not going to say don‚Äôt download it but all you see is a flash of light and a black circle appears were the meteor hit. But again you don‚Äôt see the impact or the asteroid flying in space. I would love if this was a 100 percent sandbox and you could control much more than a flash of light and a black circle. Only good thing about the game is how great the earth looks. Keep in mind the better device you have the graphics will stand out. But that‚Äôs it.', 'The graphics on this game is stunning and I enjoy the puzzles. But I agree with what other people are saying. Instead of just a light and then a black circle and then a gray wasteland for a mark, I think it needs more of a explosion...more dramatic. Also they‚Äôre should be news, for example, maybe there could be people that are told to evacuate the area or something like that. So basically what I‚Äôm looking for is better explosions and be more realistic. But in other words this game is great and has good potential. Can‚Äôt wait for more!']"

Basically a stab, and run mentality. And obviously, this isn‚Äôt very cheap do these actions, or to try and defend yourself. The ‚Äúattacks‚Äù on other players, or even the AI is skill-less.

There needs to be a restriction on who can you attack but you cannot attack anyone who was way below or higher than you. And the resources and cost is unbearable.

It's is a little on the difficult side, but for some this is part of what makes it such an strong  title. I wish there were a bit more 'redneck, trailer folk, white trash' type units. These units are, dare I say, endearing? In my opinion some of the units, like Carlos and the swat team, don't really fit into the ethos they have created. But this comes down to personal presence and is a minor gripe - because overall, the game is excellent. It is both unique and familiar, cohesive and well crafted - and yet wonderfully subversive. The gameplay is quick and fun. The wide range of units and enemies does help with the occasional threat of repetition. The ability to swap parts from unit to unit would be a great addition. Again, this is a personal and minor gripe.

There are troops on a weekly basis that are sold for real money or an outrageous amount of cash that would take you half a year to save up for. And the characters inside are all ridiculous. When I face them in 1v1 skirmish I almost always lose because of how pay to win they are. Especially the sets with like 4 characters that all buff each other.Overall the game is mad fun, but I‚Äôd like to see more rewards for putting time in to the game and less for paying 10 bucks for some stupid Superman squad.', ""Hello! It's Dead Ahead Zombie Warfare team! Thank you for taking the time to leave a review! We will take your suggestion into consideration to make the game better."", 'This game is fun and I‚Äôm a huge zombie fan. The concept for the game is great and I love working to get a new character, but it‚Äôs extremely difficult without paying real money to get in game currency. I don‚Äôt mind going back and grinding older levels I have played, it‚Äôs fun I think. The levels do get pretty difficult quick which is fine but to upgrade your character as well as your bus for the amount of coins you get with the levels that you CAN beat. Can being the key word, makes it just a strenuous grind with not much reward. As I said love the grind that‚Äôs the point of the game but the characters become weaker with each level because the monsters are very OP in hordes. So again level the characters and bus to upgrade the characters further, but not enough coins given. I would suggest other goals or achievements to get coins other than just trying to accomplish to get as many stars as you can because after stage three it gets hard to get three stars on most levels (if it can even be beaten). I‚Äôd suggest reducing some zombies hp or just simply adding more levels to give the players chances to level some characters and the bus. The game is great and I love it but not perfect. If there were chances to receive more coins by grinding or any other manner I‚Äôd definitely give the game 4 to even 5 stars.', 'IF YOU HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH PAY TO WIN THEN YOU DON‚ÄôT EVEN NEED TO READ ANY OF THESE, JUST PAY.At first few level you can still get resources through watching ads, but once you reached level 8 everything started to get harder and harder, and every level in this game is getting crazier, it‚Äôs going to make you think maybe it‚Äôs something you did wrong, but it‚Äôs not! And finally you will find out there‚Äôs no more missions you can even survive over 60 seconds don‚Äôt even mention passing it you will realize that you have to pay to get better units and more resources to move on, couple hundreds of coins you get through watching whole bunch of ads won‚Äôt help at all because you can‚Äôt even pass any missions anymore, and everything in this game is more and more insane!Now there‚Äôs two way in front of you, either you start paying real money for better game experience or you delete this thing. I chose the last option and trust me you don‚Äôt want to go down to the road when you have to‚Äúpay to win‚Äù, doesn‚Äôt worth it at all!I understand that everyone needs to make money and bring the bread to the table, but pay to win will do nothing but ruining a wonderful game, I would rather pay first then enjoy the game without any micro charges just like most of the games on pc (like steam) and consoles.', ""Hello!

The only possible thing I could complain about is the fact that the difficulty becomes steep quickly. I can't complain much though, I like the challenge. I just wish that every so often you could go back to the first area and there would be the ability to get more items or you'd have to reclaim the areas because the zombies would take em back. It'd be pretty cool ya know? Like you stop playing for a week and when you come back all of the areas you cleared have been reinforced. Maybe they're stronger? Who knows, and maybe a wondering boss that's hard to kill but gives good loot or several bosses ranging in difficulty.Update: The game is still the same as I had posted before, though a small complaint I have is the flame thrower units. They will begin to attack when their enemy is just out of range. Say I have the Glenn and he‚Äôs attacking a zombie, the flame thrower unit will go up to just behind Glenn and either set him ablaze (not the zombie) or just continue to spit fire till he runs out and Glenn is dead an by the time he‚Äôs able to spit more fire, he‚Äôs mostly dead if not already dead."", 'Overall I love this game it has an awesome art style and game design.  But I have some complaints, It‚Äôs very frustrating that the only way to get skins and a lot of characters is by buying them with real money and they are all crazy expensive.  There isn‚Äôt a way to really farm coins without Austin which means it takes a very long time to make simple purchases.  This game can be very difficult where several hours can go by without much progress being made. why are there only 3 ‚ÄúBosses‚Äù in locations 1-4 I think we need more bosses not just enemies with a lot of health. Bosses that change how the game is played especially the marauder boss with the truck was a lot of fun to play and an interesting way to mix things up.  This game is super addicting and I love it.  I believe that everything in a game should be accessible with a lot of grinding and without the use of irl money however you should be allowed to speed up the process with irl money.  Thank you for reading this rant I really appreciate it and thank you to the developers you guys did an awesome job and I love the graphics!']"

It is pretty much the same as the original with a few major differences.  First it is MUCH shorter.  I think the original had somewhere between 65 and 80 levels.  I assume this developer will introduce the levels as updates but for the money they really should give you all of them at once.  The original also had no ads at all.  I'm one of those people who really think that any app you pay for should have no ads at all.  This review would be 3 or 4 stars if it wasn't for the ads.  Beyond that the play and layouts are identical to the original except the backgrounds are cheaper looking and not as detailed.  The original was .99 so if this version goes any higher than that it's not worth it, at least until they introduce all of the original levels.  Worth a dollar if they keep updating levels.

For one my main is issue is when your playing games you‚Äôve got one defensive formation, and three offensive formations, and only one run play and one pass play for each. Now I know I can go to advanced to setting and change who I hand it too, or throw to, but it takes away a lot of strategy. It would be nice if you unlocked one new play for each formation each time you level up your strategy center.

1321791212,"['When this game kept on popping up on my feed I decided to see what the hype was. I started playing and it was confusing but eventually I got the hang of it! I like how you don‚Äôt have to pay to get most of the games features. That doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not out of the question to improve.For instance, I don‚Äôt like the fact that someone has to give you flowers to gain popularity, it‚Äôs really hard to gain popularity then. I suggest a way that players can gain popularity by using other items or giving rewards to others instead of waiting for flowers that might never come. It‚Äôs also frustrating when you see a icon that tells you that something is there for an event that you can‚Äôt remove. An example is the new seven day event where even when you go through the days and all that could possibly turn the icon off, and it still doesn‚Äôt go away!Overall, the game is wonderful and has beautiful visuals and they let the player decide what choices they make! Yet there is still room for improvement. There is my two cents on the game.', 'Hello! My name is Evelyn and I have been playing this game pretty much since the English version came out. (Bout 3 years ago) I‚Äôve been on an on and off streak where I play like 2 hours a day for a a bit then take a break and come back the next week. A lot of people are saying that if you don‚Äôt go on EVERYDAY then you‚Äôll lose a huge fraction of your might. But that wasn‚Äôt the case for me. I hadn‚Äôt played for at least 5 months, and it only went down 4K, and I have over a million might. Another thing though, was there was a glitch with the jade. Idk if this is still a problem, but this is what happened: So basically I wanted to buy 10$ worth of jade to buy something for hero summoning. So I bought it and It said wait so I went to bed and got on the next day to see if I had it. I decided to wait a bit longer but here I am, a year later, jade-less. I haven‚Äôt bought anything in the game yet. On the other hand, I LOVE this game! My formation is wan‚Äôer (got from recruit) Mulan, (shard synthesis) xuanji, (got her from some reward box) and zifu (shard synthesis). So basically my might is 1.3 million and I haven‚Äôt spent a cent on the game. All in all, You don‚Äôt HAVE to spend anything on this game, unless you‚Äôre going for cross-server ranking or leaderboards. So, if you haven‚Äôt already, I would DEFINITELY get this game. It‚Äôs my second fave at the moment and the graphics are flawless. :3 anyways, hope you enjoy your day!-Evelyn', 'Saw an ad for this game while playing a different one and thought I would try it for a bit. Ended up liking this game much more than I expected! It was confusing at first because I was just lead to press certain buttons, but after awhile you do pick up on how the game works. I like that this game isn‚Äôt too reliant on spending actual money. I haven‚Äôt spent anything yet I‚Äôm having a blast. There‚Äôs always events going on which spice up the routine and factions allow you to get some friends and support right away. It‚Äôs a lovely mix of RPG, styling, battling, crafting, social, and competition. I would like to make some suggestions. I think there should be a mini guide or help button for all of the different sections. For example, I didn‚Äôt realize what smelting was doing until much later. I wish I could reference a guide to read up on what to do in certain features. It would also be helpful to have a pause button for the dialogue since I sometimes can‚Äôt keep up with the pacing. It would also be useful to pause if you need to do something really quick but don‚Äôt want to miss out on the story. Otherwise, I‚Äôm having a lot of fun. I‚Äôm so glad this got translated to English! Although, this game is making me consider learning Chinese.', 'When I first got the game I fell in love with it! I loved the graphics, the characters, and the storyline too! But I, not to long ago, updated it, and I had to download the pack and everything but when I logged in to my main account on there it didn‚Äôt work. On the game I have six accounts(üòÖ) and I tried to log in to all of them and the same thing happened. It didn‚Äôt work. Saying that I had a connection problem but everything was fine! And since I had this game nothing had happened before about the connection. So I at first I really thought it really was the connection and I restarted my phone and got back on the game and logged on each of my accounts and again the same thing happened! I still wasn‚Äôt able to get on my accounts! Sooo I wrote down my sever name and then I switched it to another then back. I logged on, only 3/6 accounts worked. I was a little annoyed by that but after awhile being off the game. I went back on logged on to my main/very first account and it said I had the wrong password. I know that the password was not incorrect. So right now I have only 2/6 of the accounts I use and the frustrating thing about it is that the most of my accounts are high levels that I put quite a lot of time in them and my main account was at level 86. I love this game. But it‚Äôs just so frustrating right now!', ""Hi there, thanks for playing Royal Chaos. We'll need more information to help find your account back. Please send us an email at hw_service@haowanyou.net with your previous game records, and screenshots if applicable. We'll work to help you with your issue."", 'First off I liked the game and the graphics. It is a really thought out game. I‚Äôm not complaining about it being boring since there is so much to do. So then why 3 stars? Well I gave this game 3 stars because of 2 reasons. 1: when you first start the game (after the story line and intro) they basically leave you on your own. You don‚Äôt really know what to do or how to level up. So you just keep battling until you get defeated and the helper tells you to go get more hero‚Äôs etc. As you keep going into the game you start discovering things you wished you knew earlier to have a better head start. I really think they should give you a full walk through.2nd reason: You loose might if you don‚Äôt play 24/7. Like me, many players don‚Äôt have time to play everyday. I lost 12k might just by being absent for 1 day. Imagine if I went on a trip and was absent for a whole month. I would practically loose everything. I also have many classes and exams to attend to so I don‚Äôt have time to play this all day. This is the main reason I might get rid this app. Also I don‚Äôt really have spare money to waste on this game. So if you‚Äôre a free player its really hard to get costumes and you can‚Äôt get jade. That‚Äôs all I wanted to say. I really hope the game developers fix the loosing-your-might-if-you-don‚Äôt-play-all-day problem.', ""Hi there! We're really sorry for your bad experience.

Please keep supporting us and contact hw_service@haowanyou.net for help with any issues."", 'I absolutely loved this game at first, the lovely costumes the storyline, which is so so but still keeps you interested, and the fact that there are so many things to keep you occupied. I‚Äôm to the point where I‚Äôve passed the storyline until there‚Äôs a new update, which made it easier to advance in the game because you win materials for reading chapters, anyhow the main problem is once you reach around 500k might the game is slow and the materials are so expensive, the exchange rate of jade to ignot is ridiculous and it literally takes weeks to gather enough materials to further advance in the game, plus I always wanna buy the new costumes, but most are upward of $50 dollars a piece, and you‚Äôll spend  hundreds trying to upgrade later in the game. I would love it if in the next update the costumes and extras would be more affordable, because I‚Äôm likely to spend more money over time then pay $50 dollars for a costume and be broke, then $5 dollars here $10 dollars there, this app would probably make more money, well at least off me. The chat rooms are often gross, which I don‚Äôt like, and the game is quit unclear and difficult till you get the hang of it, also they definitely need to explain how to use gems correctly, and what all different characters you need in a cast. Still a fun game though, but probably won‚Äôt play much more unless prices go down.', 'This game was fun at first. The biggest problem is when it takes over 58k might from you for no reason except you can‚Äôt play it as long as the game would like you to. There are middle school, high school, college kids,  and parents who play this game. No one has time to be on this game all day long. Not only am I a parent of 3teens but I live in chronic pain from illnesses and injuries. I started playing this game to take my mind off some of my pain but when it is at it‚Äôs worse I can‚Äôt play and get penalized big time for it. For the past 3 days I worked to get my might to 825k only to log in each morning and end up at 720k, last month I lost over of 350k of might and none of it was loss of faction might I lost it because I was not playing long enough, this is not fair to those of us who play daily, spend money on this game, and help others out in the game when you have people who have not been on in 30days, are rude and vulgar, and don‚Äôt help anyone, yet still have all their might. I‚Äôm also in a faction that makes it impossible for me to get promoted because me and 2 other people are the only ones who actually do the quest, donate, and everything else we are supposed to do, yet I and some others keep getting our might taken from us.

Like other reviewers said you have to put money in for jades to buy upgrade materials otherwise you can‚Äôt get anywhere. Also new outfits price are ridiculously high 20-50$ a piece. More over in the server that I‚Äôm currently play right now it‚Äôs so unfair because there are so many player on the East Clan. Everybody chose to be on the Empress side (East). When the clan war is on, East side always win because most of the time there was like 50 people on the East compete with 13  people on the West. Which mean more players on East side in this server. The top faction is also on the East side as well as the top players. They‚Äôre all in that same faction and get all the benefits. I think game developer should create a clan switch or clan should be chosen randomly when enter the game instead of letting the player pick. Because what‚Äôs the point if you can‚Äôt compete fairly. Lastly, auto battle is so boring, there should be battle between players to make the game more intense and fun.', ""Hi Lillie, thanks for playing Royal Chaos and we're truly sorry for that!

It‚Äôs main problem is that, if you don‚Äôt buy extras, it‚Äôs very slow and difficult to advance once you get to a high level, so you can‚Äôt play very much and it‚Äôs boring. This problem is worsened because there is so much going on, so to advance in this way you have to buy this thing, and to advance in that way you have to buy another thing. It used to be fun to have so many different things to focus on, but now it‚Äôs just a long chain of things you need to get that leads to you having to buy jade or ergot packs. Another annoying thing is that you‚Äôre forced to see people‚Äôs comments during stories, and their mostly all-caps ‚ÄúGAYYYY‚Äù, which I don‚Äôt really want to have to be a part of.

Troops are different from SS too, you have knights and goblins instead of samurai and ninja, lol. It‚Äôs cute. Training troops takes forever, even at L1, and upgrades take forever.

The only aspect to the game that I find lacking is that the helpful hints when being introduced to new aspects of the game do not automatically turn off when you replay that particular level. Other than the feeling that 3.5 seconds of my life time are wasted in repeating the same identical steps (as opposed to the reality that I have allowed hours of my day to be consumed by an animated feline) I am quite the happy camper!', ""Hi ChrisseyNicole, Thank you for taking the time to write such a comprehensive review.  We really appreciate your positive feedback and are pleased you're enjoying the game. We'll pass your comments to the team - it will make them smile:) Team Pop Time"", 'I really like this game but it has one incredibly irritating and annoying aspect. It keeps timing out on what are called key lock gate levels. Even if you defeat the lock on the first try, the game times you out for 4 HOURS!!! Times outs are for EACH of three keys on one level. This is particularly annoying when another aspect of the game is running on a timer as well and you lose time on that booster. I don‚Äôt understand why a game with ads would block out someone from playing it???!!!??? I‚Äôm not talking about losing lives and waiting to get them back. This annoying time out is even when you win a round! It‚Äôs almost enough to keep me from playing this ADDICTING but annoying game! It would be a 5 STAR game if just this one aspect was changed!I see I‚Äôm not the only one complaining about this aspect. Time gates may be common in games but that doesn‚Äôt mean they have to be present. Time outs when you‚Äôve lost lives is one thing... total FOUR HOUR stops (really EIGHT to TWELVE) because there are three keys) IS ABSOLUTELY REDICULOUS. Put a gate time if you think you must, but make it much less time. And please explain the rationale behind them more than just everyone has them. It just makes NO SENSE!!!', 'I downloaded this a few hours ago and have been playing nonstop (which is kind of unfortunate because I‚Äôm supposed to be cleaning my house lol). I love Simon‚Äôs Cat and the cast of characters in the game, which is why I decided to try it. They are too cute. I wasn‚Äôt sure the game would hold my attention, but I‚Äôm really glad I gave it a try. Popping bubbles is so gratifying!I like that there‚Äôs not tons of ads. I can choose to watch them if I want and earn extra coins. This is the best way to get people to choose ads instead of the ads being forced on you like in some games- it ruins your enjoyment of the game a little. I don‚Äôt totally understand how to get the stars on the levels, but it‚Äôs not impacting my enjoyment of the game. Someone who likes to be more competitive will enjoy figuring out the way to maximize points, but for me, I‚Äôm just over here happily popping bubbles. Definitely recommend for all gamers.', 'I‚Äôm rating this game 3 stars - it‚Äôs fun and mind numbing after a long day of work, which totally makes it a 5 star game, but the ads that are WAY too long and the 6+ pop ups every time you open the game are just too much. Open the game, choose play (duh, what else would you do???), get to the in screen map and automatically get notified about every time based thing that is going on or has ended and you have to click out of each of those. And maybe a new one has started so you have to click through all of those. Then any in-game ads for booster packs. And don‚Äôt forget the request to link to Facebook or the request to send you notifications for game updates (who would make that choice????). Then to play a game you get the option to choose boosters before you see the level. Then the option to get a random one within the start of the level. And then when you‚Äôre done an add that could easily be limited to 10-15 seconds. That‚Äôs a LOT of extra nonsense that is not actually playing the game and it wears me out. My SO was playing too but got so sick of the pop ups that they bailed.', 'I saw this on an in-game ad and thought it looked fun and the animations made me laugh. I played for quite a while enjoying the levels until I hit a gate that needs 3 keys. You can play for keys but must wait 4 hours in between plays?! The first one was beaten easily enough, but the second one (after waiting to play it) can‚Äôt be beat by me so far. You can buy a key for 70 coins ( which I haven‚Äôt earned yet), or connect to Facebook (which I don‚Äôt want to do) and ask friends for keys. Starting out the interface was nice and clean but is now cluttered with free gifts, timers, event countdowns and the like. I liked being able to watch an ad to earn extras on some levels, when it works. Half the time the loading wheel spins to select view ad and the button never appears and it just goes into the level. I understand the developers want to make money from the game and to some extent I will spend a little here and there and watch ads when I can, but I haven‚Äôt even been at it a full day and I‚Äôm hit with pay to continue or wait 8hrs (if you pass the key challenges).', ""Hi, Thank you for taking the time to write a review.

However when I\'m at the start of a level and the umbrella power up is not highlighted (ie I can\'t select it) I know the game doesn\'t have any water balloons in it. On the other hand, sometimes when the umbrella is actually flashing, as if to say ""use me"", and I select it .....once the game opens, I find there are no water balloons at all and I\'ve wasted my umbrella! This happens about half the time, so needless to say I\'ve wasted a lot of umbrellas! And then I\'ll get to another level where the umbrella is flashing, and I ignore it (having lost faith in it due to its previous deception)...only to find that this time I should have selected it because there ARE water balloons!! So frustrating because I\'ve spent money on those things and I don\'t want to waste them!

I have spent hundreds of dollars on this game and I have never done that before, so that is a testament to its entertainment & addictive qualities, but why can you offer a membership price, or the line?  And there really should be many more ways to EARN coins in app.  The piggy bank is also far too small and $4 to open it early is absolutely INSANE. I am pretty good at the game & have one or placed in multiple tournaments, but I still end up bleeding money.

1133478462,"['Hello people who made this game, I gotta say, imma huuuge fan. This is very nice, very well made, it‚Äôs just great, but there could be some changes, like with customization with the tower and archers. The tower is able to be customized with different weapons like a ballista, machine gun, canon, etc‚Ä¶ but it looks extremely ugly, same with the archers, they need new costumes, I feel like that would make people happy. The market place in the town is a downside too, it is nice that you can get rewards, but it is lame that you have to be in a good position to get the crystals.

Also, the leaders, the troll king uses the ability to bring trolls to your side, like the orc king, but the thing with the orc king is that he used the axe orc, and mage orc, yet doesn‚Äôt use the tnt orc, I find this quite annoying, but it is okay.

You get to pick from a list of predefined cards of how many from each side can take action, and this gets exhausted until you take a turn refreshing it or pick another side to work on.  There are some other special movement cards you can use, but this DOES NOT feel like it's a strategic choice. It feels like a limitation for some unknown reason.  Combat is not good either.  When you fight, units can hit, miss, push, or get a rune action.  The rune result feels like it should not be a result of combat.  You can use rune powers on groups when you get enough, and they are cool, but the way you get them from combat is stupid.  The push action is SUPER annoying.  This means sometimes when your group can hit twice, instead it pushes away and can only attack once.  So these two things combined in combat result in a system that is annoying.

I\'ve been playing the 3rd mission for the past 3 nights, and still can\'t beat it. It is definitely a trial by fire, and I\'m sure I will come out of it a better player (the digital, and boardgame version) but the process can be quite frustrating. It can be quite annoying when you are constantly rolling blanks, and the enemy uses a lore power and they are rolling 5-7 dice and always hitting at least half their rolls. Still a great game, and maybe after a pit more practice and tactical thinking, I will be able to roll over the AI, but I think that will take some time.

Post-knight and now Post-knight 2 is out, but Tiny Guardians hasn\'t gotten anything new. Issues for me:1. You can\'t bring new units to previous missions - makes doing older missions more of a chore than enjoyment, and takes away the fun of the challenge (can\'t use new ""cards"" on hard-mode either).Possible solution: allow new units to be used on older levels right away, or maybe it\'s unlocked after finishing the main storyline.2. The story is sweet, but once you complete it, besides endless mode, there isn\'t much to do/aim for...Possible solution: New game-modes, or maybe a ""portal to another world"" situation, or Lunala does a new map with [Spoiler].3. The game screen and features are copy and pasted when played on different platforms. So, on my iphone I can barely read some of the writing due to how the game fills the screen, or I can\'t see some of the time release circles because they are almost completely offscreen!4. Targeting issues: the way the a.i. targeting works makes it impossible for you to ""make"" your units attack a particular enemy, so sometimes your units are decimated because the targeting system doesn\'t allow you to ""prioritize"" certain targets!Overall a great, smoothly built game that is tricky to play, at times, but fun to pick up!', 'Hi Toxicole, thank you for your detailed suggestion!

Guiding the main character through hoards of baddies is very fun, and in some fights it gets quite hectic, swiping here and there trying to herd your lil defensive units to safety. Sometimes it‚Äôs a little too hectic, and even on my large phone screen it‚Äôs easy to poke the wrong unit during a fracas leading to some minor frustration, but it mostly works well. The graphics are unfortunately the main reason people assume this is a Kingdom Rush clone. The character design definitely has its own style though, and some of the units are downright adorable.

You play as a summoner who can conjure up various summons to defend you on the move, instead of building towers to stop enemies coming towards you. Unfortunately the fast-paced nature of combat and the auto-movement of the summons make it so there's very little actual strategy involved beyond summoning the units - the game tries to claim that positioning them is important, but it really isn't - they position themselves.Still, it's cute, fun, got a decent plotline, fun twist on traditional tower defense... music isn't great... I'd play it again. But the Kingdom Rush games are much better (with the exception of Vengeance). If you're looking for tower defense and haven't played those, they're easily the best in the genre.

981800298,"['I found a guild that helps members upgrade based on a strategy of sending rss to 1 player to hold until a certain player is ready to shield and accept rss to upgrade. There is a method of keeping track of who is next and a very active leadership who is in constant communication to notify members of events and how to best win based on various factors.  Once you upgrade your ship to level 12, you will have unlocked all but 1 investment option.  Save or buy enough gold to fill them all up, train only tier 1 infantry and upgrade your commanders and skills as often as possible (commander level upgrades are easiest as they don‚Äôt require any special troops or rss).  The only people who complain that games are lopsided to the strongest players are those who never bother to understand the dynamics of a game and how to play effectively without spending money (preferably)or at least, not spend a lot of money to keep up with players who do spend a lot of money.I have multiple accts in many games where people complain about the same thing yet I always end up managing to stay competitive without spending over a paycheck worth of money to be the largest player around.That being said, my biggest issue is the drop rates of event items/the time it takes to collect them.Other than that, this game is fairly innovative and very unique with regards to all of the different things that can be done in it.', 'I played the game some time ago, and for whatever reason, I stopped. I‚Äôm prone to stop and start games frequently. I picked it up again yesterday in a brand new world and joined a great guild, so I spent a few bucks to get the S commander pack and some gold for rolls which garnered another A hero and I was having a great time. Problem was, I had saved the prior game to Facebook and Game Center, so I was unable to bind this game before I blew and loaded the old one.Customer service was unbelievable. I had a 16 hour conversation with at least one agent and attempted to start fresh on two new worlds so he or she could bind my new account to the one I wanted to play from yesterday.I really thought it would end with one request and a canned response, but this is the best customer service experience I have had since IOS paid gaming started.As for the game, very unique battle system using same air beats vehicle, vehicle beats infantry, infantry beats air model, bu5 you set up your commander with 6 positions to counter your attacker/defender. The ark is complex, but similar to a castle builder, only mobile, so porting is not the only relocation option.', 'I agree with some of the other comments I‚Äôve seen here. It is impossible to make any progress because stronger players steal everything you have. There needs to be a limit against who you can attack to make it more level and fair. Like if only level 15 players could attack that same level or higher, it would make the game more evenly balanced. Every time I get up in the morning, there are several notifications on my phone that my ark has been attacked by players that are nearly double my strength and have obviously spent hundreds of dollars on the game.That is the other downfall. You are forced to spend money to enjoy the game. Even worse is that even if you do spend money, other players can still prey on all your resources and everything you have left is not even close to enough to get back to where you used to be. I like the other aspects of the game such as daily missions and fun guild events but I am going to quit playing because I find myself more frustrated rather than having fun. It‚Äôs a shame. If they ever correct the balance then maybe I will come back. Funny part is, I wouldn‚Äôt mind spending money if it actually made a difference and there was more balance between the higher and lower power levels. But the best games are also enjoyable without having to spend money. I‚Äôd advise not playing unless you just want to be food for larger players or if you have hundreds of dollars to spend.', 'Thanks for your review. Thanks for your suggestion. We would convey it to dev team. They would take it into full consideration. Players could also survive without paying. All ideas from players would be of great value to us. Could you share them with us? Thanks in advance.', 'I really liked this game a lot but I find myself playing it less and less now because of the addition of the unlimited crystals needed to upgrade. All you can really do is sit around and farm continuously. I sat down and figured out that just to get ONE of the LOWEST upgrades in the advanced battle section, you are looking at $1,757 worth of real money in shadow matter JUST to get to the LOWEST advanced battle tier of T10 (Genesis, Gaia or Death Angel). You MUST have at least this tier to be competitive in the game. They added these crystals AFTER many people had already reached this level so now catching up to those folks is well......pretty much impossible. I have been playing for YEARS and am still pretty far out of reach from the higher tier folks just because of the unlimited (cash-flow) crystals addition. This game will frustrate you to no end and make you mad every time you get hit and can‚Äôt do anything about it. You‚Äôre better off taking a pass on it and saving yourself a great deal of stress and money. Probably one of the greediest companies on the App Store. Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention, they let people cheat with multiple accounts and boost their resource productivity also. They could stop this simply by disabling resource assistance but it profits them. If you have only one ark, you won‚Äôt stand a chance. They are also lazy about updating the game.

But if you do not intend to spend real money at some point you will realize that it is a waste of time. And if you do intend to spend money it will be a waste also. But of course the choice is yours. When someone attacks you in this game your medical centre only holds a few of the injured and everyone else get lost. You have to rebuild again. Rebuilding means lots of resources, but you are unable to accumulate as mush as you need because as soon as you log off you are under attack and resources (rss) plundered. I feel like some of these attackers are in cahoots with the developers. If you want a steady upgrade with spending then you must purchase a shield which prevents invaders from attacking you. These shields are not cheap. Then they give you a chance to earn a nice powerful commander which they say is free. It‚Äôs laughable because the tasks they want you to perform can take so long that if feels like you‚Äôre being forced to spend gold for the so called ‚Äúfree‚Äù commander. You can skip the task that seems impossible for the time frame, but for thousands of gold. Gold costs real money. Like I said the choice is yours, but sometimes it pays to be informed. There‚Äôs no balance in the games. You either spend a lot to get ahead or just be a farming target for those who do spend.', 'Thanks for your feedback.

Supports in app purchases. First package, $5. Then you can‚Äôt buy that one again. Then you have to buy the $10 package, and then the $20 package, and from there the price goes to $99. Got deep pockets? Help this developer retire. This game is garbage. Nice interface, lots of stuff to do to keep yourself busy while players higher level than you kill all your troops that cost you excessive resources and time, which you can‚Äôt protect because to have enough units to protect yourself, you might as well take the money out of your pocket and set it on fire. Doesn‚Äôt matter what level your medbay is, once it reaches capacity, all the rest of your troops are killed. One player with a higher level than you, can wipe out all of your troops in minutes. Your cargo bay is severely undersized. The only way to level up your ship when higher level players are killing you every time you turn around, is to break out your wallet. Seriously.

', ""The game is unique but hold many flaws. One of the most prominent of them being the level balance. As it stands now, players can attack anyone of any level, and they will typically always attack lower level players. If you do not have a shield, you'll typically find yourself attacked constantly by people much stronger than you are. Because the servers you're in involve people from all over the world, these raids will continue relentlessly for 24 hours a day.This wouldn't be so bad if progression wasn't so slow. Upgrades are massive and take a lot of resources. It can take up to two days to upgrade important buildings, if you're committed to it, however because of the level imbalance, you'll typically be persistently starved of resources because the same three people who are double your level keep attacking you. Their higher level and superior commanders will take all your resources with a single attack, resetting all your progress to upgrade a building.I would not advise playing this game as it stands now. Not because it's bad, but because it is nearly impossible to make progress when all you are is helpless prey for bigger players."", 'I have played plenty of base builder games and both free to a more pay to play style. This game runs entirely on making people purchase to grow! As I have seen and will further the point of several others. They refuse to actually balance their game and provide a feasible way to get enough rss let alone troop costs. Worse yet I purchased a $99 pack and they charged it directly to my Apple wallet somehow without a email receipt. Upon reviewing the results I found a $136 charge instead of the $108 legally it should have been. I have gotten reports from other people in game, that they have stolen about $200 from the previous owner of an account the player had taken over. Directly through the Apple wallet they stated. As they did to mine. This company should be shut down by the federal trade commission and have a class action law suit against them. As well as Apple should refund all purchases this company has accumulated. As far as base builders it‚Äôs completely imbalanced and the customer service is the worst lying pack of jackals. The fact that they repeatedly say bring things up to their devs in defense of the comments here is further proof of how they handle things in game. They try side stepping issues with no actual effort put forth to fix any issues.', 'Let me preface by saying I still do like the game - I really do, but I just can‚Äôt do it anymore.  This game is surprisingly in-depth with its upgrades, commanders and commander gear, and different map elements.Starting off is brutal, and if you take the bait and pop your beginner shield to get the resource boosts, then have fun getting attacked every ten hours.  You‚Äôre essentially constantly losing resources to Chinese/Russian attackers while trying to upgrade your units to survive against the very same players.  Even when you finally do get your next upgrade, your attackers are already two upgrades ahead and they have a guild fort already AND they made an alliance with the other guild that‚Äôs been attacking you.I just can‚Äôt find the fun in pressing my nose to this grindstone anymore.  New players try to ban together to take on these guilds of players that play the game twelve hours out of the day, and they still end up getting farmed.  Even if you throw money at the game you‚Äôre already too late; you can only really buy speed boosts with your in game currency.  Unless you‚Äôre shelling out hundreds of dollars, there is no way you‚Äôll reach P2W status.All in all, it‚Äôs a good game, and I really like it and wish I could keep playing it, but I just don‚Äôt enjoy having a learning curve as intense as Mia Khalifa‚Äôs hips.', 'The game is very in depth. Lots going on which is amazing! But here‚Äôs the problem. The developers don‚Äôt listen.

It‚Äôs unfair when you are a level 8 trying to gather resources and work up only to have a level 12 come and take your resources over, and over, and over. Alllll night and day. While writing this review I‚Äôve gotten 3 notifications I‚Äôm being attacked...... where‚Äôs the incentive? Spend money? Not gonna happen on my end. I‚Äôll spend money on games I enjoy. You wanna make it enjoyable, make it so only same level players can attack same level players. We can deal with loosing to a same level player. Not some crap when you lose constantly to players 1-9 levels higher than you. You provide a free game so I understand you need to make money somehow. But turning people away isn‚Äôt how.

You have the CHOICE to watch an ad if you want extra money or diamonds but the game is 100% playable without watching a single ad. If you enjoy the grind of a classic RPG game you will fall in love with this game. Leveling each aspect of the game up is super addicting and satisfying when you reach your peak. Not to mention the multiple maps they added in as you progress through the story. I have beaten it multiple times simply because its such a satisfying experience. I cannot give this game enough credit. Thank you to the people that created this game it has by far given me the most enjoyment I have ever had from an iphone game.', ""I've played all sorts of tapping games and most I play for a day or two and it gets boring. Absolutely not this one. It's very unique and keeps me wanting to go back and keep playing. I suppose the only thing that frustrates me is how much money I lose. I had a trader at 70% chance and invested 22 billion coins and they lose all of it! And not only does it happen once but multiple times on all traders which makes it very hard to get coins to advance. Especially since tapping hardly gives you anything once you reach a million (unless you have a 5 star tapping trader). I mean I eventually did pass the US level but only because I used a bunch of diamonds. It's not impossible but I suppose it gets frustrating. Otherwise this is a really fun game and I do recommend it!"", ""This game is fantastic. Where do I start? The events, traders, furniture options, customization of your CEO, it's all there! If you ran out of lives on your match 3 game, this is your game to play until those lives come back. The traders are creative, the furniture is optional( though some have perks to help you in the office) and you have three more offices to use after finishing America. The events unlock perked items that look fantastic. My only issue is the difficulty of finishing an event completely. It took me over 300 stars to get the last item in the most recent event. 100% recommended!"", 'This game is one of few great games on mobile and it shows. It‚Äôs fun and always a great time killer. However, i wish you could get rid of ads for things like the in-game mail and whatnot. even if it‚Äôs a IAP for $0.99 or something.

Due to a cap on stock trading amounts that becomes unfeasibly expensive to raise, your money amount raises linearly very slowly rather than exponentially, and unless I‚Äôm missing something that is the entire game to this point with no hint of anything else other than changes of scenery. Terribly balance and realized but fun concept. Many other games do it better.', ""We are very sad you did not enjoy the game. we'd love to hear more from you on how we can improve the game to 5 stars at support@pixio.co"", 'My favorite game but there is one problem I needed to delete it on my old phone for storage problems so I bought a new phone that is what I am texting on now.

Anyways, it‚Äôs like you can decorate a room, but it‚Äôs all stuff you have to pay for, which stinks. Thanks for reading. üòÅüëç', 'Hello, Retavtla. You will not believe I have read every word in your review. Firstly, I have to apology, for our team about the server problem in Aug 15 and 16. It is totally our fault to result in your bad game experience. But I promise that this is the first time that the server went down for such a long time, and this will never happen again. But in today‚Äôs afternoon, we have launched a scheduled server maintenance which including the version update. Most of players have regarded it as another server shutting down. We are truly innocent this time. Secondly, thank you for all your support and sincere feedback and suggestion for our game. We really appreciate that. Your suggestion will all be forwarded to our developers and technicians, which will be considered in our next update. Also, I‚Äôd like to say that we have added a time zone adjustment function in our new update. It‚Äôs an English friendly function that allowed you to change your rest time according to your time zone. We will do all we can to make a stable and comfortable game environment for you. Anyway, have a good game, we believe in your victory, my Lord. Thanks for reading. :D', 'Besides server issues the game was actually awesome and would play every day and even spent like $50 on it for an event, but a while ago they changed the Merit system where you would have to grind significantly more to get merit chests. If you don‚Äôt grind merit chests then you flat out don‚Äôt progress. The only way to progress without merit chests is paying for it. Also the constant addition of new wanted heroes is tiring to players who don‚Äôt play that much. I was a level 34 mayor and keeping up is a struggle, the new wanted hereos were always better than the previous ones Making it an unfair battle every time for those who are unlucky with wanted token draws or who don‚Äôt pay to win.

This kind of sloppy graphic doesn‚Äôt look professional.2. Timezone. Please put people in the same timezone together. I changed mine to UTC+7, 07:00-15:00 to fit my schedule. I live in Los Angeles. But then the other players are on Asian time. So when I am awake, they‚Äôre resting and I get charged 10x provision when it‚Äôs my time to play the game. So they‚Äôre resting for 8 hrs, then when they‚Äôre awake, I am the one resting. So eventhough I want to spend more time on the game, but the 10x provision makes it really expensive to attack. So I only have 8 hours when I can attack my opponents normally, the other 16 hours, I get charged 10x provision. Not fun.3. As the levels get higher the difference between money and non-money players become starker. So I stopped playing because suddenly the game doesn‚Äôt seem balanced. I saved up my resources to be able to go on a full attack and after a tough fair balanced battles, many times the opponents still have soldiers in the ten of thousands. How is that possible? Well, you know the answer.', 'This game was created first for Asian players and later arrived to the US market. Overall I find the game play very good, you don‚Äôt have to spend money to have fun but if you want to grow powerful it makes it hard not to. I have been playing for almost a year now and have seen some good improvements but continue to have a hard time getting proper help when reaching out to the ingame customer service. Whenever I report a bug or issue I get a cookie cut response and not a resolution. This is very frustrating at times and can be very irritating when they are at fault and refuse to fix the problem. An example would be that if a player loses an item during one of their updates they will blame the player and not replace the lost item.', ""Hi, thank you for taking out the time to send in your feedback.We'll keep working hard to improve the service.

The good games are where your playing people that haven‚Äôt put to much money in while playing steal leaving it a far match.  But at the end of it all.  It‚Äôs only worth playing if you put money in to it.  Like $100 of dollars.  It‚Äôs not even funny how much they want you to spend to enjoy it.  Game is only targeted for people with money.  They can say plenty of people become top plays with out paying money but You people should know better then that.  Haha.  It is a fun game but can‚Äôt rate it more the. A 2 for this reason', 'This game has a lot of potential. I don‚Äôt normally play games like this because of the paying to win aspect. I think what could make this game different from other pay to win games would be to have a separate server for people who don‚Äôt want to pay for anything you know a server without the option to pay for stuff. I think it makes it more challenging when you don‚Äôt pay for upgrades and what ever else. Having to pay just to get a victory kinda takes the fun out of it.

1254864644,"['One of my fondest memories was spending hundreds of hours playing the original Pok√©mon games. Nexomon, while having a lot of similarities to Pok√©mon, feels like something unique. Something special. I spent pretty much most of my free time playing this instead of actually gaming systems. It was actually something that pulled me in so much that I spent a couple nights where I only got about 3 hours of sleep before work. If you‚Äôre looking for something to remind you of the good ol Pok√©mon days, or even just a good game for younger kids that haven‚Äôt jumped into similar games yet, this is an amazing choice. The humor is spot on, they have amazing references to other pop culture things, and the game is very self aware it‚Äôs a game. The story is actually pretty nice and engaging as well. There are only a handful of faults that I can find, and most of that has to do with the cash shop in a paid game. Nothing in there is needed, so you can ignore it, but it is annoying because you will have two big buttons on the top right hand side the whole time you‚Äôre playing. These buttons take a lot of space and are only there to make sure you‚Äôre aware there is a cash shop. The game is so good that you‚Äôll forget they are there for most of your play time, but when you notice it, it‚Äôll get under your skin. The game is so good that I would honestly just pay for a full $20 release.', 'A refreshing monster-collecting and battling RPG adventure. The storyline is enchanting and the characters are well designed and likable. The designs of the Nexomons are original and the animations are very smooth. The game isn‚Äôt P2W (pay to win) which is really nice. The extra purchase options will make the game easier, faster, or adds more customization options, but they‚Äôre not necessary at all to complete the game. The soundtrack is rather beautiful: relaxing at times and intense when appropriate. The creators and the team did a great job at developing this game and creating this universe. I only have a small issue with the game, and that is with the battle system. The statistics of the monsters isn‚Äôt well explained. Battling is very fluid for beginners to this genre of games, but could be very awkward for more advanced players. Most monsters don‚Äôt have very diverse strengths in stats with others of the same rarity level. Abilities/moves also don‚Äôt have an adequate description. You only know the energy costs for the moves, but the game doesn‚Äôt provide its Power or Accuracy. Also, status inflicting moves have a ridiculously low percent of landing. If the developers can change up the battling mechanics, this game would be perfect.', 'First of all it‚Äôs a great game. It‚Äôs like playing Pok√©mon without actually playing Pok√©mon and it gives off the same feeling. However, my only problem are levels. I like to grind levels on my monsters and it‚Äôs frustrating to see that even though I win against Omnicrons children I still lose? I have a level 76 Carnagrius that went up against Arqua when I was omw to the desert. I killed her using slash because it dealt 750 damage and Arqua had 2500. Same with Grunda. I defeated both of them and I understand for the sake of the story I had to lose. But if I had to fight a person who I was going to lose to no matter what at least make the monsters tanky or insanely OP. It is a bit disheartening that I can defeat them easily but still manage to lose. On a side note, I really hope you allow the option of a fixed joystick and possibly make it bigger? It‚Äôs hard to control your character especially with a small screen. The maps are a bit small because everything is big. I‚Äôd like it if it was a bit smaller. There‚Äôs also not enough npc‚Äôs to battle. While it‚Äôs easy to level up grinding wild nexomon it‚Äôd also be helpful to have more npc‚Äôs. I feel as if I‚Äôve battled less than 10 npc‚Äôs which is not a lot and it is fun to battle against them. Other than that it‚Äôs a great game to play!

There‚Äôs some slight problems I have, and seeing the last update was 1 year ago, I doubt there will be another update to fix these things, but I hope you see this and think about improving the game. First problem is there‚Äôs no map to show you where to go, sometimes I spend minutes to almost an hour trying to find out where to go to continue the quest and it can be frustrating not knowing where you‚Äôre going. Second problem is there‚Äôs nothing to determine when and which Nexomon will evolve, it‚Äôs annoying leveling up a Nexomon and not seeing it evolve after so many levels, the least you guys could have done is install something to show which ones will evolve and at what level, the same way you guys did with the special moves, had it locked and hidden until the level was reached, the evolution could‚Äôve been hidden until the level was either close to the evolution level or until the level was fully met.

You see there are people out there that would call this a Pok√©mon copy but in my opinion this could very well stand on its own. I love the Characters in this game. The Nexomon are really amazing to in were they look amazing. One of my favorite parts is that they brought references of micromon to this game because I lovers that game so much and how it brought more backstory to it like what happened in the ending or who created micromon. This is definitely one of the best games in the App Store and I recommend it to anyone. One thing you should do hopefully is play micromon before this so you could get where the references are coming from. One big thing I like is that rare and mega rare Nexomon have 3 evolutions so it makes it better to collect them and more rewarding.

This one is a lot more user friendly, so much less handholding, enough difficulty that it isn‚Äôt boring, while still not being insufferable amounts of grinding. While I don‚Äôt recommend it for children under 12, it‚Äôs still an amazingly open age range, difficulty and interest wise. And it doesn‚Äôt sacrifice story or graphics and things. It also doesn‚Äôt include that classic annoying Pok√©mon rival. Also the way that it allows you to want to fight the trainers, instead of being forced to. Not to mention Pok√©mon (Pok√©mon Go isn‚Äôt a Pok√©mon made game, it was made by Niantic, and Google) doesn‚Äôt have a good mobile game. The only bad thing that I can say is that the UI placement hasn‚Äôt been fully fixed on newer smartphones, and the ‚ÄúNexobox‚Äù and ‚ÄúDiamonds‚Äù UI can end up in the middle of the screen. Otherwise amazing game, more then worth the money, I‚Äôd spend +$10 on it.', 'Update: Their Customer Support Team is phenomenal!

It reminds me of an old iOS game where the user hopped from world to world defeating the bosses and capturing the monsters from each world. The gameplay is great HOWEVER, and I don‚Äôt believe the developers would intentionally do this, the in game shop is currently bugged. I purchased a gem bundle and the counter for the purchase ticked up from 6 seconds to well over a minute. After force shutting down the app it confirmed my purchase but never exchanged the gems. I am currently sitting on a pending charge with no in game currency. I‚Äôve sent a support email and will change this review to reflect my game experience once the issue is resolved. Thanks!', 'First things first THIS IS NOT A POK√âMON RIPOFF! They have their own monsters own twists own turns and the legendary are something else to face when you face them they seem eons ahead of you but are beatable with the right strategies. In the first Main game of Nexomon it is very linear and straightforward but just going through the story doesn‚Äôt bring you to a powerful enough point to fight some of the legendary Nexomon or ‚Äúboss‚Äù trainers (overseers). The Expansion is very hard and was fun to play it added another major challenge in the form of New legendary Nexomon and another very powerful one.ComplaintsThis game is resource heavy you need a lot of healing items but the status eliminators are useless because all status‚Äôs last one turn.

315733642,"['Hi! I never leave reviews, but wanted to really wanted to thank the developers for this newest update. I downloaded this game out of pure nostalgia, but also kept playing it because I ended up really liking the simple gameplay. However, the paywall, ads, and frustrating little details would make me super disappointed. But this newest update has been an absolute huge step in the right direction; not having to guess the right location after waiting 8hours, not having ads shoved in my face every second, and being more generous w/ items to their loyal players has made me very relieved. There‚Äôs still lots to do, like making the employees not cost real money, but i‚Äôm really loving this update and i‚Äôm excited to see more improvements in the future!!', 'If I was rating this game solely on gameplay I‚Äôd give it 5 stars. The gameplay is fun for the most part. But the game as a whole has major issues. There are levels where the difficulty feels super unfair. For example, on New York‚Äôs expert 3rd level I had literally finished the day serving all but two customers with 5 stars. Kept trying, would always be like $10-30 off the goal. Am I supposed to get EVERY customer with 5 hearts? Now THAT‚ÄôS impossible. Speaking of impossible, the level system for upgrading your equipment is tedious and useless. I have over $20k earnings in this game that I can‚Äôt use because by the time I‚Äôll be able to upgrade my second massage table, i‚Äôll be nearly done with the game. And what‚Äôs with the bizarre prices for in the in-app purchases? $5 for ONE employee? That‚Äôs ridiculous. The fact that the full game pack costs $35 is just‚Ä¶ wow. You could buy a whole game with 20+ hours of content for that price on steam or something. But no, this is a literal app store game charging $35 for the ‚Äúfull game.‚Äù And as for the 8 hour flight wait, I‚Äôm honestly not even sure who thought that was a good idea. Do they think it‚Äôll annoy us to the point where we pay for fly instantly? So weird. This game is fun, the gameplay is great, but that‚Äôs honestly about it. Everything else is just‚Ä¶ a mess. I wish the rest of the game did the gameplay justice.', 'Changing my old review in light of recent updates-I will say as terrible as the paywall is, I am thoroughly enjoying this game. It is insanely difficult at times but not impossible and after not being challenged by the old game I can appreciate the difficulty of this new one. I‚Äôm glad the new update lowered the travel time to 2 hours for going back to previous levels but for the love of god please tell me before I fly if I can actually play that country. It‚Äôs so discouraging to wait to play then immediately get blocked from playing the first level because I don‚Äôt have the necessary upgrades and have to wait 2 more hours just to go to a different country I still might not be able to play. That does not entice me to pay $20, it just makes me annoyed. I did catch that one level where after some failed attempts I got a free ride to a recommended country, that‚Äôs super cool. But when I‚Äôm on the world map screen I need some indicator of which levels I‚Äôm able to play. I still think the cost to unlock the full game (no wait times, no ads, access to employees) is asking too much, I would be willing to pay for a full version but $20+ ain‚Äôt it.', 'Honestly the developers might as well have just sold the game for $30 and I would have been happy. But no, instead, they make assistants, which basically become absolutely necessary mid to late game, cost $5 EACH, and then proceed to annoy you with ads and everytime you retry a level and wait time because it‚Äôs so difficult so you can pay $10 for each country/continent. Now, I‚Äôve been playing all types of games on all types of platforms for many years, and my conclusion is that if you‚Äôre not essentially a mobile esports player, there is no way you can play this game for free. And even if you are, you‚Äôre not using this game to de-stress after work, you‚Äôre playing if you‚Äôre so bored out of your mind and something like renovating your entire house isn‚Äôt an option. Also not that big of a deal, but having to build a mindset of prioritizing the highest tippers and ignoring the customers that are a lost cause in order to win the game doesn‚Äôt make it an escape from reality anymore. I don‚Äôt really wanna be reminded of how people step on others to survive. In my head, if the developers think that‚Äôs okay, then it must be what they‚Äôre doing. Other people can find kinder games than this if a change isn‚Äôt made.', 'I love this game but there are some frustrating issues that are unnecessary in my opinion. First off, I wish you could accomplish all the levels in one location without having to get farther along in other locations. The most annoying part is that it doesn‚Äôt specify where to go a lot of times. You just have to guess and hope that after waiting 8 hours for the flight to get there that you went to the right place. You should be able to finish a location and then go straight to another one without having to wait 8 hours or spend $20 to buy the game. Another annoying thing is having to wait to buy upgrades till you reach a certain point. I have tons of money in the game and as long as I can afford the upgrade I should be able to buy as many as I want. The game is fun but I hate it when the creator tries to make it as annoying as possible so you‚Äôll purchase it. Just let us play without waiting ridiculous amounts of time or having to fly back and forth to get more badges.', 'Edit: Oh buy the original game at $6.99 in the App Store cause it‚Äôs basically the free version because in this version just one out of the three spa assistants is $4.99 (initially). And that‚Äôs just the start of it, in the long run you‚Äôll end up spending more money in this version. I‚Äôm enjoying it now like long time ago, cash gimmick free. I just spent $60 is less than a week on a mobile game that use to basically be free to play years ago!!! Almost everything will require to use cash. Want to go to the next location, pay or wait 8 hrs, want to barely make a level? Buy a bunch of candles and teas to barely scrape by with customers coming through the door with one heart and already on the verge of losing that one heart upon arrival! You barely get any in-game currency to upgrade anything or maybe their upgrades are way too expensive that you can‚Äôt upgrade crap! There goes a childhood favorite right out the door. At least I can play delicious deluxe, hopefully they haven‚Äôt become what this monster has become. They could‚Äôve done things in moderation but nope they want to eviscerate your hard earn paycheck for a MOBILE GAME.', 'I used to love this game when I was younger but the in-app purchases have ruined the game. Overall gameplay is fun and challenging which is why it‚Äôs earned 3 stars. I like the challenge of time management and doing multiple things at once. Not only does it create a fun game but also has helped me in real life learn to manage my time a bit better. That said- the game still needs a lot of work. The fact that every place takes 8 hours to fly to when in real life it would be half the time is ridiculous. The fact that you have to upgrade to get to the next level is ridiculous too. I have spent all day flying to (only) two different places because I needed shop upgrades. I went to play a level and I needed to get more shop upgrades but you can‚Äôt get more shop upgrades unless you play another level. But you can‚Äôt play another level without leaving your original spot and flying 8 hours to another spa. Then- you get there and find out you need more shop upgrades THERE. So now you‚Äôve wasted 8 hours and have to fly ANOTHER 8 hours. The game doesn‚Äôt tell you WHERE to go it just says ‚ÄúLol sorry gl‚Äù I really like Sally spa but I don‚Äôt want to pay $30+ to play the game. If you could speed up flights with gems, or even buy the full game for a few bucks I‚Äôd be much happier. But I could buy a better name on my Nintendo Switch for that price. I like Sally spa as a time waster but as a game I‚Äôd pay money for- it‚Äôs far from that. TL;DR Fun Game- Awful Waits', 'I re-downloaded this game because I remembered playing it in 2013 and loving it. I actually finished the whole game (except for getting a perfect on every level but I‚Äôm not a completionist). At the time you could upgrade everything and get the helpers just by using the rewards won from the levels. I didn‚Äôt mind as it was relaxing but still engaging to replay the levels. Now however, you either have to either watch an ad to play each individual level, or pay a couple of dollars to play the spa (not the whole game just that particular spa) with no ads. You can‚Äôt even get the helpers with in-game earnings, you have to pay for them too. Additionally, as I said, I last played this game back in 2013 and it seems the graphics and gameplay have not been updated in all that time. The game doesn‚Äôt fit right or appear crisp on the newer screens of 2022. Sad to say I didn‚Äôt even continue this game pass the third level of the first spa. It‚Äôs clearly went from an entertaining game with heart to a nickel and dime operation.', 'I used to play this game on my iPod back in junior high/early high school and I LOVED IT!! You could earn money and awards from levels and even get bonuses for getting a perfect score on a level! With those earned rewards and money, you could hire other people for your salon, upgrade your chairs or baths, and overall make your spa more enjoyable and make levels a little easier to beat. Now that was years ago. I stumbled upon this game again recently and nostalgia hit me hard, so I instantly downloaded it. Now, I can‚Äôt play a level without watching an ad, I can‚Äôt hire new people without paying $4.99 and I have to physically wait 7+ hours for Sally‚Äôs ‚Äúflight‚Äù to take her to a new city. I‚Äôve barely played 10 levels and I want to delete the game. I used to be able to play for hours and never grow tired of it. Do yourself a favor and DON‚ÄôT download it, even if it‚Äôs for old times sake. I‚Äôm deleting it immediately after I write this. Sorry, old friend Sally. It‚Äôs not the game, it‚Äôs the developers. 1/10', 'This game tricks you into spending money in order to complete levels. It doesn‚Äôt allow you to upgrade items in your shop with in game currency‚Ä¶ you have to spend real life money- so then you do and you get a good 2-3 rounds and then once again are put in the position to spend real life money in order to get through to the next round (I‚Äôm talking like, playing and losing a round after 15 try‚Äôs when you only needed $2 in game coins to pass) It continues this pattern until you‚Äôre left with the empty gut feeling that you just spent hard earned money on a game that‚Äôs developed to have you lose unless you are spending your real life hard earned money. Now here you are, without the $20 that you had to work two hours to get and without the app you just played to waste a bunch of money on and delete bc if you keep it you‚Äôll just spend more in frustration. Not worth it! Save your money and experience something better than miss sally and her little spa‚Ä¶.']"
1298915029,"['So Titan Throne isn‚Äôt exactly the most ‚Äúfresh‚Äù content but what is here is well executed. On launch there isn‚Äôt any game breaking bugs so bravo for that. However, it does have some drawbacks such as long wait times for troops who are lost too easily, The tutorial is bad if non existent, and you have to choose a faction without knowing much about any of them except the aesthetics and no matter how much you attack a mine it will not allow you to secure it as yours whether you occupy or plunder and sit you wanna zoom in particular areas of your city good luck with that. So there is room for improvement but it‚Äôs a new game and to be expected.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîIn Game the gameplay at first is lame and dry but as you join an alliance it helps grasp and captivates you.

Aside from the drawback of base members being 20 in a guild the guild aspect is very polished.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîOverall thoughts and concerns are that the support does take a while to reply it‚Äôs been 3 days now so that‚Äôs terrible. Beware of spenders and micro transactions if you get city wipes you lose it all since most of your power is from your troops so wary on spending at first until you somewhat grasp the game. In Game user: AlexAstro', 'As a player of WAO I didn‚Äôt know what to expect in this game. It is quite different from WAO and it has its good and it has its bad but overall me and my alliance enjoys this game and is having fun playing it. I have had the luck of playing with my original members from the alliance I played with in WAO though so this is a learning experience from us all but a good one. I like how they have a cheaper monthly pack and a full monthly pack that way everyone will have access of a monthly pack unlike WAO. Many great ideas that WAO lacked and they placed in this and there are also many they took away as well, like being able to send resources to alliance members and also making resources very hard to come by, but st the same time it allowed for a challenge that we never had to do in this game before. Thank you for creating another great challenging game that requires teamwork and another game that you don‚Äôt have to spend any money at all and can still grow and play and have fun in.', 'If I could put 0 out of 5 I would. It doesn‚Äôt even deserve a 1 star. Absolutely the most trash customer service. You will always get the same generic answer. ‚ÄúThank you for your feed back we will forward to the development team‚Äù knowing they aren‚Äôt going to do anything about it. Constant lag or glitches that cause you to not be able to play the game. No refunds of rewards that are lost when glitches occur. Avoid at all costs. Nothing but wallet warriors. Expect to spend loads of money to keep up with the wallet spenders. Camel games only concern is to keep putting out different buyable packs every week than to give you more quality content. Camel literally took content from wao and put it in this game. Camel was so lazy. Camel didn‚Äôt even change the name in the update from wao to titan throne. Camel as a game developer is only after your money. Camel prolonged the game by putting updates in that slow your growth or make it were you have to wait weeks to months to build up enough of either blood or hero cards to enhance. Which is sad because this game has such potential but in the hands of camel it will die out.', 'To give a straight and honest review, it‚Äôs not bad. I started off thinking it was another in of the mill thousand dollar to win kind of game and I was pleasantly surprised it‚Äôs not. So far I‚Äôve been able to progress rapidly and spent next to nothing and I‚Äôm quite enjoying the game. Lots of stuff to do and honestly hard to keep track of everything. My gripes fall under the concept that the game does have a lot of limiting factors that preventing you from growing to quickly which is both good and bad. Also the navigation of the map is this game is trash, there is no indication of where alliances are located or players and you are forced to search for them manually and then write down the coords so you can find the location quickly. But all in all it‚Äôs a refreshingly new experience for this type of game and I intend to continue playing for a while. Cheers', 'So I‚Äôm gonna be honest the game is fun the game is addicting but the game is not developed to what it should be. You cannot buy speedups with Gems. It‚Äôs pretty hard to get your hero card ranked up. The cool downtime or building times are very high for just beginning for example in technology there is a day and 10 hour wait time. For energy at the start of the battle. (Or something like that). It is very hard to gain power from buildings and technology there‚Äôs not much to build at the beginning most of your power will come from troops... Which leads me into yet again another complaint the time that it takes to train at the beginning for the amount of troops you‚Äôre going to train is outrageous. Yes I do spend and I also grind. There is no vip system or anything to give and edge for spenders stats wise or cool down wise.Realm 76- TheForgottenKing', 'I am very pleased with finding this great game.It plays like most mobile strategy games where you have your kingdom, unlockable tiers of troops based on kingdom lvl, heroes to hire and use to evolve themselves and each other, an adventure timeline to help boost your heroes xp lvl, monster battles on the world screen, action tiles and resources tiles to occupy and drain/defend, and of course a gem system which is actually very fair compared to other titles like this.Anyway that all sounds like just another war game right?  But Titan Throne throws on nice spin with their Hero Types.  You can choose from four different types of kingdoms, human, undead, orc, and uhh elf I think?  I didn‚Äôt really look I just went Undead and I am having a lot of fun with this game.It feels a lot less like a pay to win game, strategy and alliance decisions will outweigh gem purchases as gems are mostly used for speedups for tech, troops, and construction rather than epic gear for your heroes.I know this review was a little long but as a long time mobile gamer and even longer time console and pc gamer I know good work when I see it and I would like to see the community grow so this game can get really fun!', 'A lot of hype around this game a year ago.  Multiple timely updates.  New realms opening frequently.  Promises made for continued development - even within the game portions say ‚Äúcoming soon‚Äù.

Most have left the game out of frustration with Camel and highly unbalanced hero‚Äôs that time and money invested  has been a complete waste as they stopped rebalancing and updating.  This has left the game with a few Alpha hero‚Äôs that people were lucky enough to have selected over a year ago when development was active.Camel is very lucky they are not held to U.S. ethical business standards.  I‚Äôd recommend staying away from this game and any other Camel game.

If you like games that are interactive and you get to play with others from across the world then try this game out! I do have cons ! It takes money to be able to upgrade in a reasonable time. If you want to survive you‚Äôll have to spend money or you‚Äôll just become a farm to the bigger guys in this team. Some of the concerns I have is the packs that they offer on here are just a little to pricey ! Secondly, they really don‚Äôt have any good packs to buy. I would like to see them have gear packs available!! That would help a lot of us smaller guys from being completely destroyed ! And I think they should have events that are reasonably able to be achieved. Like diamond events and gear events and so on.

After the first realm merge, I moved to a new realm thinking a fresh start would help me keep pace with others, which it did for a while until the next realm merge.. now I‚Äôve been merged once again in new realm and it took me almost two full months to catch up to earlier realms progress.. now just as I‚Äôm catching up we are announced for yet another realm merger to an even earlier realm which means I will again be surrounded by stronger players who will try to farm my castle.  I‚Äôve been a paying customer for almost a year and I demand a full refund as no money I could possibly spend can prepare me for the developers greed and need to push smaller player in to feed their biggest money players.

Those are also the only events as the game has not revieved an update for months. When me, or any one of my team mates contacted the developer team regarding bugs we are met with an automated answer or they blame our internet. They have also taken cash bought gems of players claiming they have bought third party packs which 100% never have. I feel scammed, and like I wasted my time.

Sometimes the door have locks but you can't take too long because you could crap your pants!"", 'So i just got this game and was exited! I waited for it to load and when it was nearly done, i was clicking on it nonstop!! Until..well it opened the game while it was loading but then it showed the first part of the screen and BAMM!! BLACK SCREEN!! Then it made the screen turn back to the home screen.. i tried it again a few more times but the same thing happend over and over again. And there was more but I‚Äôm too lazy to type and my i-pad is about to die. Mabey ill make part (2) of this soon xD', 'This used to be my favorite game but I got a new phone end it didn‚Äôt get transferred over. I completely forgot about it until recently and tried downloading it and wasn‚Äôt able to open the app. I love this game so please fix the bug.', 'I want to play this app but it closes me out! I can‚Äôt believe it so please give it another update where it does not close me out please?', 'This game was my childhood memory, when I finally found the game, I was so excited! I downloaded it and tried to play it, then the second I start loading in, it closes me out! I deleted it and reinstalled it, and it still closed me out for no reason. I tried shutting my phone down and turn it back on and it still closed me out. Don‚Äôt get this game, it doesn‚Äôt work!', ""One of my friends told me about this game that she had and I couldn't find it but then when I finally did it has been like the only game that I have played all day this is the best game that I have ever had""]"
